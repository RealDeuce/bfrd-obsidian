***Age.*** Beastkin mature far more quickly than most Humanoids, reaching adulthood within 5 years. Though they may live nearly a century, some beastkin live only 20 or 30 years.

***Size.*** Your size is Medium or Small. Beastkin vary in weight and height, depending on their Beast characteristics. Most are between 4 and 8 feet tall, but if you choose to play a beastkin shorter than 4 feet, you can choose your size to be Small. Your weight varies depending on your Beast characteristics.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Animal Instinct.*** You have proficiency in either the Perception or Survival skill (your choice).

Work with your GM to determine what type of natural weapon you possess and decide whether it does bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can use your natural weapon to make unarmed strikes.

* ***Agile.*** Sharp claws, cloven hooves, robust limbs, reversed joints, or suction pads on your hands and feet allow you to scrabble up trees, rock faces, and uneven surfaces with ease.

* ***Aquatic.*** Oily fur, scales, fins, webbed hands and feet, or long, gangly limbs are common for your people. You have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. You can hold your breath for up to 20 minutes.
