# Aware
You have exceptional situational awareness. When you select this talent, you gain these benefits:
* When you roll for initiative, treat any d20 roll of 9 or lower as though you rolled a 10.
* As long as you are conscious, you can’t be affected by the surprised condition.
* Hidden targets don’t have advantage on attack rolls made against you.
# Covert
*Prerequisite: Proficiency with the Stealth Skill, DEX 13 or Higher*  
You trained in the art of espionage. You gain these benefits:
* You can attempt to hide while in three-quarters cover or while lightly obscured.
* Creatures that rely on darkvision can’t see you while you remain motionless in dim light or darkness. This effect ends if you move, take an action or bonus action, or use a reaction while in the creature’s line of sight.
* You don’t have disadvantage on attack rolls and WIS (Perception) checks against targets in dim light.
* If you make a ranged attack against a creature or if a creature spots you while you are hidden, you can use your reaction to make a DEX (Stealth) check at disadvantage opposed by the creature’s Perception. On a success, you remain hidden and the creature is unaware of your position. Once used on a creature, the target can’t be affected by this feature again for 24 hours.
# Dungeoneer
You’ve studied—or at least survived—your share of hazards and learned a thing or two about sniffing out secrets. You gain these benefits:
* You can add your PB to checks made to disarm traps and open doors, even if you aren't proficient with the tools to do so. The first time you fail an ability check while disarming a trap, opening a door, or passing a hazard, the failure doesn't trigger the trap, block the door, or force you into the hazard’s area—no consequence befalls you from the failure.
* You have advantage on Perception and Investigation checks made to search for secret doors, find traps, and see through illusions.
* You have advantage on saves made to avoid or resist traps or hazards. You are resistant to damage from traps and hazards.
* When combat begins, you and allies within 5 feet of you can attempt a DEX (Stealth) check for the purpose of determining who is surprised.
# Far Traveler
You have traveled the world and been to many fantastical places. You gain these benefits:
* You and your allies can travel up to 10 hours each day, instead of the standard 8, before you must make a CON save for a forced march.
* Traveling at a fast pace doesn’t impose the standard −5 penalty to your passive Perception.
* You have advantage when you make a WIS (Survival) check to determine if you become lost.
* You ignore the effects of having one level of exhaustion. When you have two or more levels of exhaustion, you suffer the effects of exhaustion normally.
# Field Medic
You trained to provide emergency medical assistance.
When you select this talent, you gain these benefits:
* When you make a WIS (Medicine) check, treat any d20 roll of 9 or lower as though you rolled a 10.
* As an action, you can tend to the wounds of a creature you can see and touch. When you do, the creature regains a number of hit points equal to your PB + their CON modifier. A creature healed in this way can’t receive the benefits of this feature again until it finishes a short or long rest.
* When you spend hit dice to regain hit points during a short rest, you can reroll a number of dice equal to your PB and must take the new result.
# Polyglot
You have studied language extensively. You can communicate in multiple languages and puzzle out critical information from languages you don’t know. When you select this talent, you gain these benefits:
* Learn three languages of your choice.
* When you converse with a creature in a language you both know (other than Common) you have advantage on a single CHA ability check made to influence or interact with that creature. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
* When you make an ability check related to understanding the meaning of a verbal or written language you don’t know, you can add your PB to the result. If you have proficiency in a relevant skill or tool, double your PB for the roll.
# Quick
You are uncommonly agile. While not wearing medium or heavy armor, you gain these benefits:
* Your speed increases by 10 feet.
* When you take the Dash action, you can move along vertical surfaces during your movement.
* If you fall, as a reaction you can ignore a number of feet equal to 5 times your PB, lessening any fall damage you take. If this allows you to ignore the entire distance of a fall, you can land on your feet.
* As a bonus action you can move up to 5 feet without provoking an opportunity attack or expending movement.
# Scrutinous
You have a keen eye for detail. You gain these benefits:
* When a creature you can see speaks in a language that you know, you can discern what they are saying even if you can’t hear them.
* You gain a +5 bonus to your passive Perception and passive Investigation.
* When you spend 1 minute or longer examining an object for fine or hidden details, you can ask your GM one question about it, and they must answer truthfully.
* If you hear a creature speak for 1 minute or longer, you can mimic its voice. A creature familiar with your target can succeed on a WIS (Insight) check opposed by your CHA (Deception) to understand the ruse.
# Trade Skills
You honed your skills to work in a particular profession. When you select this talent, decide what that profession is and gain these benefits:
* Gain proficiency with one skill and a tool or vehicle relevant to your chosen profession. Alternatively, gain proficiency with any combination of two tools or vehicles relevant to your chosen profession.
* Double your PB for one skill you are proficient with. That skill must not already double your PB.
* You have advantage on checks you make where both a tool and skill you are proficient with would apply to the check. For example, when identifying a plant, if you are proficient with the herbalism kit and the Nature skill, your check would have advantage.

You can select this talent multiple times, but you must choose a different profession each time.
# Touch of Luck
Fortune’s favor always makes its way back to you. You gain these benefits:
* When you would gain 1 Luck as a result of failing an attack roll or save, you instead gain 2 Luck.
* If you have 5 Luck and would gain a 6th, your Luck total resets to 1d4 + 1.
