These gods rule from a sky-high mountain realm called Olympus, but they are far from removed from mortal affairs. Deities of this pantheon possess terrifying power over natural forces but are ruled by all-too-human passions that cause them to perpetually bicker, fall in love, and war with one anotherâ€”often at the expense of mortal bystanders caught in their wake.
