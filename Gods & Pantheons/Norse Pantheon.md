These gods hold court over harsh lands that can claim the lives of mortals not strong or clever enough to survive. This struggle is mirrored in the pantheon’s cosmic struggle: perpetual warfare against forces working to end everything. Their powers and bombastic personalities reflect the strong leadership and decisive action required to survive, while embracing life’s pleasures.
