Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the archdruid retains its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA modifiers, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.\n\nThe archdruid can choose to instead magically transform into an Elemental that has a challenge rating no higher than 6, or back into its true form. If it transforms into an Elemental, the archdruid can remain in that form for up to 6 hours then must finish a short or long rest before it can transform into an Elemental again."
