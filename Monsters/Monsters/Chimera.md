resistant: Multiple Heads, Monstrosity Resilience
traits:
  - name: Bickering Heads.
    desc: "The chimera is perpetually one step away from arguing with itself. A creature that can see the chimera can use a bonus action on its turn to appeal to one of the chimera’s heads with bribes (dragon), praise (lion), displays of magic (goat), or other clever manipulation of a head’s desires. The chimera must succeed on a DC 15 WIS save or succumb to that desire.\n\nIf the lion or goat head succumbs, the chimera has disadvantage on the next Bite or Headbutt attack it makes before the end of its next turn. If the dragon head succumbs, creatures caught in the chimera’s next Fire Breath have advantage on the save, provided the chimera uses the breath within the next 1 minute. Once a head has succumbed to a desire, that head can’t succumb again for the next 24 hours."
