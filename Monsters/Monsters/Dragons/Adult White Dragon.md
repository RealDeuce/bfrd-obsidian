  - name: Ice Walk.
    desc: "The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. In addition, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra movement."
  - name: Legendary Resistance (3/Day).
    desc: "If the dragon fails a save, it can choose to succeed instead."
  - name: Numbing Chill.
    desc: "When the white dragon hasn’t unleashed its Cold Breath, the cold builds up within it and ripples outward from it. While the dragon’s Cold Breath is available, it emits a numbing chill, and each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 CON save or its speed is reduced by 15 feet."
legendary_actions:
  - name: Detect.
    desc: "The dragon automatically detects every creature and trap within 30 feet of it, pinpointing the current location of each."
  - name: Tail Attack.
    desc: "The dragon makes a Tail attack."
  - name: Elemental Roar (Costs 2 Actions).
    desc: "The dragon roars at up to two creatures of its choice within 120 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 CHA save or be vulnerable to cold damage until the end of its next turn. A target resistant to cold damage isn’t resistant to it for the duration. A target immune to cold damage is still immune to it, even if the target fails the save."
  - name: Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).
    desc: "The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 DEX save or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [[../../Conditions/Prone|prone]]. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks."
