    desc: "The doppelganger transforms into a Small or Medium Humanoid it has seen or back into its true form, which is Monstrosity. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies."
  - name: Read Thoughts.
    desc: "The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts—what is foremost in the mind at the moment—of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading the target’s thoughts until its concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell) or it uses Read Thoughts on a different target."
