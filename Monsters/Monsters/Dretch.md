    desc: "A 10-foot radius cloud of disgusting green gas extends out from the dretch, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The cloud’s area is lightly obscured and lasts 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. A creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or be [[../../Conditions/Poisoned|poisoned]] until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can’t take reactions."

The new body appears in a random location in the Abyss. Only sprinkling holy water on the dretch’s remains can prevent this trait from functioning."
  - name: Demonic Resilience.
