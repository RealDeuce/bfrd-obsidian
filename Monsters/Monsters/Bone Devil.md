    desc: "The bone devil shouts one of the following commands at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 CHA save or obey the command. A lesser devil, such as a barbed devil or lemure, has disadvantage on this save.\n* **Attack.** The target uses its reaction to make one melee or ranged attack (the devil’s choice) against one creature the    target can see within its weapon’s range.\n* **Beg for Mercy.** The target immediately falls [[../../Conditions/Prone|prone]] and can’t cast spells with verbal components on its next turn as it is magically compelled to speak pleas of mercy.\n* **Flee.** The target uses its reaction to move up to its speed directly away from the bone devil. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, but the target doesn’t avoid damaging terrain, such as lava."
