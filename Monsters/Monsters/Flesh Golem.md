If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its HP.\n\nThe golem’s creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 CHA (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If the golem takes damage while still at 55 HP or fewer, the golem might go berserk again."
