  - name: Wild Reach (Recharge 5–6).
    desc: "The chuul taps into ancient memories of magic and reaches toward nearby magic with an unpracticed grasp, releasing a burst of energy. Each creature within 15 feet of the chuul must make a DC 14 DEX save, taking 21 (6d6) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a magic item, spell effect, or spellcaster is within 30 feet of the chuul, the burst is pure arcane energy, dealing force damage. If no magic is within 30 feet of the chuul, the burst pulls from the chuul’s own life force, dealing necrotic damage. If the damage is necrotic, the chuul takes necrotic damage as if it succeeded on the save."
