    desc: "When a creature the merfolk can see hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it, the merfolk can twist its body to scrape the attackerâ€™s arm or similar attacking appendage across the rough coral of its armor. The attacker must succeed on a DC 11 DEX save or have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn, as its attacking appendage hurts from the abrasion."
