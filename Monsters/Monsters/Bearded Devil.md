If the target is a creature other than a Construct or Undead, it must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or lose 3 (1d6) HP at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 3 (1d6).

The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing, provided the target is capable of regaining HP."
