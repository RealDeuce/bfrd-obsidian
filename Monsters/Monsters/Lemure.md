Each creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the lemure and that isn’t a devil must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or be weakened until the start of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls, and it deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength. A creature that fails this save by 5 or more suffers one level of [[../../Conditions/Exhaustion|exhaustion]]. A creature that has suffered a level of exhaustion from this lemure’s Rippling Heat can’t suffer another level from this lemure’s Rippling Heat for 24 hours."
