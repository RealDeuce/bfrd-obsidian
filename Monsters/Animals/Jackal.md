    desc: "*Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.  *Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or contract shriveling fever disease, named for the way the disease causes an infected creature’s muscles to shrivel. Until the disease is cured, the creature is [[../../Conditions/Poisoned|poisoned]], and at the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or its STR score is reduced by 1d4. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature’s STR to 0, the creature dies. A creature that succeeds on two saves recovers from the disease."
