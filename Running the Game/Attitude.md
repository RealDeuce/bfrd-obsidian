The attitude mechanic presented here can guide any ability checks used to resolve any social interaction.
# Set Starting Attitude
Begin by choosing the starting attitude of the NPC(s) involved in the interaction: friendly, neutral, or hostile:
* Friendly. A friendly NPC is willing to actively help PCs and generally wants to see them survive and flourish. Friendly creatures perform simple and reasonable tasks or favors without coercion. Persuading a friendly creature to perform a potentially harmful task or act in a way opposed to its nature requires a successful CHA check.
* Neutral. A neutral NPC has no strong feelings toward the PCs (positive or negative) and treats them as is most beneficial or logical for the NPC. Neutral NPCs might be polite, disinterested, standoffish, or any behavior you might extend to strangers or acquaintances in the real world. Persuading a neutral creature to perform basic or low-risk tasks typically requires a successful CHA check. Persuading a neutral NPC to perform a high-risk task is more difficult.
* Hostile. A hostile NPC is unwilling to help PCs and generally wants to see them fail. Being hostile doesn’t necessarily mean the NPC wants to attack or threaten the PCs though. For instance, a city watch member might be hostile if they suspect the PCs of committing a crime but don’t (yet) have the evidence to arrest them. Persuading a hostile creature to perform basic or low risk tasks requires a successful difficult CHA check. Convincing a hostile creature to perform a high-risk task is usually impossible. Even persuasion for low-risk tasks might be impossible depending on how hostile you judge the NPC’s feelings to be.
# Play out Discussion
Once you set the attitude, play out the conversation (or a portion of it) using standard roleplaying.

***Shifting Attitude.*** A creature can shift its starting attitude during a conversation due to excellent roleplaying or as the result of successful ability checks. An NPC shouldn’t shift more than one step in attitude over the course of a single interaction.

***Using Insight.*** If a PC expresses a desire to intuit more about a creature, consider offering a WIS (Insight) check to glean more information about them. Clues about an NPC’s desires, mood, and behavior are valuable tools for persuasive conversation.
# Make the Check
Once the conversation ends or comes to a point where the PCs have laid out their goals, it’s time for a check. Simple conversations might require only one check to summarize the entire discussion. More complex conversations with multiple goals might have several associated checks.

The most relevant checks are likely to be CHA (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion). Choose one that matches the nature of the conversation. Consider giving advantage for excellent roleplaying, well-presented logic, or clever use of information. Similarly, consider giving disadvantage if goals or logic are unclear or contradictory. The DC for these conversational checks is determined by the attitude of the NPC being persuaded, as shown on the NPC Reactions tables.
