# Optional Rule: Doom
At the start of each combat encounter, the GM gains a special resource called Doom based on the CR of the encounter, as detailed in the Doom by Encounter Tier table. The GM can use Doom to influence the results of creature die rolls, turning the tide on the PCs or helping a creature last just one turn longer. The GM can spend Doom in the following ways:
* Give a creature advantage on an attack roll.
* Give a PC disadvantage on a save.
* Once per encounter, refresh, recharge, or otherwise gain one additional use of a limited-use feature, such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon, a legendary creature’s Legendary Resistance, or a spell in a mage’s Spellcasting.
