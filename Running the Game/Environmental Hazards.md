Curses, diseases, hazards, and traps are excellent tools to increase encounter difficulty or toss in a plot twist. All of these share a format to make them easy to run. The similarities and differences of each are described here. A few sample curses, diseases, hazards, and traps in this section include preset DCs, damage, and mechanical elements ready to use without modification. However, any of these encounter elements can (and should) be adjusted for PCs of various levels and skill sets.

# Elements of a Curse, Disease, Hazard, or Trap
Along with basic information about its nature, each curse, disease, hazard, and trap description includes a trigger, the effects once triggered, and the resolution necessary to remove, prevent, mitigate, or otherwise end the effects:
* **Trigger:** This describes the condition that must happen to activate the curse, disease, hazard, or trap’s effects.
* **Effects:** This describes what happens after the trigger condition is met. It includes ability checks, saves, and other details required to help the GM determine what happens to targets.
* Resolution: This describes how a trigger can be avoided (if possible) and ways to stop any ongoing effects.
# Effect Severity
Curses, diseases, hazards, and traps have varying levels of severity, which detail the degree of danger the effect poses: setback, dangerous, or deadly. An effect intended to be a setback is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters, a dangerous effect is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters, and a deadly effect is very likely to kill at least one character. The attack bonus of an effect, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on its severity. Use the Effects Save DCs and Attack Bonuses and Damage Severity by Level tables for suggestions based on the three levels of severity. When using these tables, disregard any information not applicable to the effect of the curse, disease, hazard, or trap you are creating.
###### Effects Save DCs and Attack Bonuses
| Effect Danger | Save DC | Attack Bonus |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Setback | 10–11 | +3 to +5 |
| Dangerous | 12–15 | +6 to +8 |
| Deadly | 16–20 | +9 to +12 |
