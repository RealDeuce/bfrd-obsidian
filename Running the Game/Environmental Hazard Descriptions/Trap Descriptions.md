This section features a collection of ready-to-use traps for your game.
# Collapsing Roof
*Trap (Mechanical)*  
This trap uses a trip wire to collapse supports that are holding up an unstable section of ceiling, which is often intentionally made unstable for this purpose. This trap can also be used to represent a collection of boulders or rocks suspended above an area.

**Trigger:** When a creature moves through the trap’s area or otherwise hits the trip wire, it activates the trap. A creature can notice the trap with a successful DC 10 WIS (Perception) check.

**Effects:** Each creature in the trap’s area must make a DC 15 DEX save, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. Once triggered, the ground in the trap’s area is covered in rubble and is [[../../Playing the Game/Movement#Difficult Terrain|difficult terrain]].

**Resolution:** A ceiling or roof can typically collapse only once, permanently ending the trap once triggered. The trap can be disarmed with a successful DC 15 DEX (Thieves’ Tools) check. A creature without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. If a creature fails a check to disarm the trap, it triggers.
# Falling Net
*Trap (Mechanical)*  
This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling. The trip wire is a few inches off the ground and stretches between two columns, trees, or similar anchor points. The net is typically hidden from view by natural covering, such as cobwebs or foliage, or by minor illusory magic.

**Trigger:** When a creature moves through the trap’s area or otherwise hits the trip wire, it activates the trap. A creature can notice the trap with a successful DC 10 WIS (Perception) check.

**Effects:** When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-by-10-foot area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and [[../../Conditions/Restrained|restrained]], and those that fail a DC 10 STR save are also knocked [[../../Conditions/Prone|prone]]. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 10 STR check.

**Resolution:** The net has 20 hit points and AC 10, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. If the net is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, freeing any creatures trapped by it. A net can typically fall only once, permanently ending the trap once triggered, unless the trap includes a mechanism that pulls the net back into place. The trap can be disarmed with a successful DC 15 DEX (Thieves’ Tools) check. A creature without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. If a creature fails a check to disarm the trap, it triggers.
# Gravity Well
*Trap (Complex Magic)*  
This trap repeatedly reverses gravity to pulp creatures caught in its area.

**Trigger:** When a creature moves to a space within 5 feet of a magical rune painted in the center of the trap’s area. A creature can notice the rune with a successful DC 13 WIS (Perception), and a creature aware of the rune can discern the trap’s nature with a successful DC 15 INT (Arcana) check. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as the [[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Detect Magic|detect magic]] spell, reveals an aura of transmutation magic in the trap’s area.

**Effects:** Each creature and item that isn’t being worn or carried within 30 feet of the rune falls upward, stopping at the ceiling or 50 feet, whichever occurs first. A creature can make a DC 15 DEX save to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall. If some solid object, such as a ceiling, is encountered in this fall, falling items and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall, taking [[../../Playing the Game/Movement#Falling|falling]] damage as normal. If an item or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly until the gravity changes again. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties) of the next round, the gravity reverses, and each creature within 30 feet of the rune falls downward, taking [[../../Playing the Game/Movement#Falling|falling]] damage if it strikes an object, as normal. The gravity continues to reverse, sending creatures falling up or down, on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties) each round for 1 minute.

**Resolution:** After 1 minute, the trap stops reversing gravity, returning gravity in the area to normal and ending the effects of the trap until triggered again. The trap can be destroyed, immediately ending its effects, by damaging the rune. Alternatively, a successful dispel magic spell (DC 13) cast on the rune destroys the trap.
# Pit Trap
*Trap (Mechanical)*  
One of the simplest, most common, and most effective traps is a deep hole dug in the ground or beneath the floor, hidden by a cover made from materials that blend with the surrounding terrain. This kind of trap can also be used to represent unstable flooring in a multi-level building, ship, or similar structure, which might send a creature walking across it tumbling to a floor below. Pit traps are typically 5 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep.

**Trigger:** When more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pit’s cover, the trap activates. A creature can notice the absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover with a successful DC 15 WIS (Perception) check. A creature aware of the lack of foot traffic over the cover can determine it is the cover of a pit with a successful DC 15 INT (Investigation) check or by interacting with the cover, such as lifting a corner or lightly pressing on it from a safe space.

**Effects:** The cover collapses under the weight or swings down like a trapdoor, causing all creatures on it to fall into the pit below. Each affected creature takes [[../../Playing the Game/Movement#Falling|falling]] damage based on the pit’s depth.

**Resolution:** The cover of a pit can be removed, but the trap otherwise can’t be disarmed. At the GM’s discretion, a pit can be filled in, or its cover can be shored up to prevent it from collapsing with at least 10 minutes of work and the appropriate materials.
# Poison Needle
 *Trap (Mechanical)*  
A spring-loaded, poisoned needle hides within a lock. This trap is most often found in locks protecting treasure chests, secret doors, or private wardrobes.

**Trigger:** When a creature attempts to open the lock without the proper key, the trap activates. A creature can recognize the lock is trapped with a successful DC 20 INT (Investigation) check.

**Effects:** The needle springs 3 inches out from the lock, striking the creature that triggered the trap or the nearest creature within range. The target takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and it must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or be [[../../Conditions/Poisoned|poisoned]] for 1 hour.

**Resolution:** The trap can be disarmed with a successful DC 15 DEX (Thieves’ Tools) check, which removes the needle from the lock. If a creature fails a check to disarm the trap, it triggers.
