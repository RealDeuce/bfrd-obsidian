# Curse of Lycanthropy
*Curse*  
This curse permanently transforms a Humanoid into a werecreature of the same kind that turned it. The curse of lycanthropy can be spread only by those already changed by it.

**Trigger:** When a creature with the Lycanthrope tag bites a Humanoid or otherwise passes its saliva into a Humanoid’s wound, it can spread the curse.

**Effects:** For the first 30 days after becoming infected, the Humanoid experiences dreams and nightmares related to the Beast associated with its curse, such as bear or wolf. After 30 days, the Humanoid undergoes its first transformation. While sleeping, it loses control of its body and acts as a member of its type of lycanthropy.

A newly cursed Humanoid continues transforming each night, remembering only fragments of these events. Every 7 days, it can repeat the save it made when it was first cursed. When it succeeds on this save three times, it gains full control of its transformation, retains its memories while transformed, and no longer has to make this save, becoming a true Lycanthrope.

**Resolution:** For the first 30 days after becoming infected, the curse can be cured with the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]* spell or similar magic. Once a creature’s first transformation occurs after these first 30 days, the creature can no longer be cured of lycanthropy, except by a *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Wish|wish]]* spell or similar magic.
# Falling Fortunes
*Curse*  
A curse that punishes the self-serving and robs people of their fortunes—in fate if not in purse. It typically protects gold or other treasure in the possession of Fey, but powerful or influential individuals might hire or convince Fey to protect their treasure with the curse.

**Trigger:** This curse takes effect when a creature steals the cursed gold pieces, trinkets, or other symbols of wealth.

**Effects:** The creature cursed is plagued with bad luck for 24 hours. While cursed, the creature can’t use Luck points, can’t gain Luck points, and can’t add its PB to attack rolls or ability checks. If the cursed creature rolls a 20 on an attack roll or an ability check, the curse ends. If the cursed creature rolls a 1 on an attack roll or an ability check, the duration of the curse is extended for another 24 hours.

**Resolution:** The curse can be lifted with a *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]* spell or similar magic. Alternatively, the curse can be ended by giving away all fortune gained within the last week to someone in honest need. This alternative resolution might be available only to creatures that discover it by succeeding on a DC 13 INT (History) check while using the researching downtime option.
# Mummy Rot
*Curse*  
This disease-like curse slowly rots a victim’s flesh.

**Trigger:** A creature has a 50 percent chance to become cursed with mummy rot for each minute it spends exposed to the remains of a mummy or to the remains of a creature that died while cursed by mummy rot. Alternatively, a creature can become cursed with mummy rot during a combat encounter with a mummy or mummy lord.

**Effects:** The cursed creature’s flesh slowly deteriorates, rotting off in flakes at first, then whole chunks as the curse progresses. While cursed, the creature can’t regain hit points. At the end of each long rest, it must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or its hit point maximum is reduced by 7 (2d6). If the curse reduces the creature’s hit point maximum to 0, the creature dies, and its body turns to dust.

**Resolution:** The curse lasts until removed by the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]* spell or similar magic. A creature normally immune to disease is immune to mummy rot, but spells and effects that combat diseases, such as the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Restoration|restoration]]* spell, have no effect on this curse.
