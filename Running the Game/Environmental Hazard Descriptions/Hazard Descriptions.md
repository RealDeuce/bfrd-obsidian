This section features a collection of ready-to-use hazards.
# Briar Growth
*Hazard*  
Briar growth is brush rife with thorns that impedes movement and scratches those that travel through it. Trigger: When a creature enters an area of briar growth, it suffers the effects of the hazard.

**Effects:** An area covered in briar growth is difficult terrain. For every 5 feet a creature moves within briar growth, it takes 5 (1d10) piercing damage. A creature that moves more than 5 feet within briar growth must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or be [[../../Conditions/Restrained|restrained]] by the thorns. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 13 STR check.

**Resolution:** Each 10-foot cube patch of briar growth has 20 hit points and AC 13, and it is vulnerable to slashing damage and immune to poison and psychic damage. If a patch of briar growth takes at least 5 slashing or fire damage, each creature that moves through that patch has advantage on the DEX save. If a patch of briar growth is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and no longer affects that area. Alternatively, the [[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Speak with Plants|speak with plants]] spell suppresses the effects of briar growth in an area, provided that area of briar growth is nonmagical.
# Freezing Waters
*Hazard*  
Icy waters can sap the strength of hearty barbarians and ill-adapted creatures alike, exhausting muscles and spirits and threatening a cold end from the exposure. Immersion in exceptionally cold water causes creatures to lose heat faster than their bodies generate it.

**Trigger:** When at least half a creature’s body is immersed in water that is 40 degrees Fahrenheit or colder, it suffers the effects of the hazard. A creature that is resistant or immune to cold damage or that has natural adaptation to cold climates is immune to the effects of the hazard.

**Effects:** A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its CON modifier before suffering its effects. At the end of each minute after that, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or suffer one level of [[../../Conditions/Exhaustion|exhaustion]]. A creature that is vulnerable to cold damage has disadvantage on this save.

**Resolution:** An affected creature must leave the area.
# Quicksand
*Hazard*  
Quicksand is a dangerous mix of water and loose soil or sand that causes creatures in it to sink into the ground. Undisturbed quicksand typically appears to be little more than sandy ground devoid of flora.

**Trigger:** When a creature enters quicksand for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it suffers the effects of the hazard. Quicksand can be recognized with a successful DC 13 INT (Nature) or WIS (Survival) check.

**Effects:** The creature sinks 1d4 feet into the quicksand and becomes restrained. At the start of each of the creature’s turns, it sinks an additional 1d4 feet. A breathing creature completely submerged in quicksand begins [[../../Playing the Game/Life and Death/Other Forms of Harm#Suffocating|suffocating]].

**Resolution:** An affected creature must leave the area. If a creature restrained by quicksand isn’t completely submerged, a creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a STR check with a DC equal to 10 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the sand.
