This section features a collection of ready-to-use diseases.
# Cackle Fever
*Disease*  
Victims in the grips of this disease succumb to random fits of manic laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname, “the shrieks.”

**Trigger:** When a Humanoid starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or become infected. Once a Humanoid succeeds on this save, it is immune to infection from that creature for 24 hours.

**Effects:** Fever, disorientation, and mild giggles manifest 1d4 hours after infection. In addition, the infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can’t be removed until the disease is cured. Any event that causes stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 CON save. On a failure, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with a fit of laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the fit and the incapacitated condition on a success.

**Resolution:** At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 CON save. On a success, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid a fit of laughter is reduced by 1d6. When the save DC drops to 0, the disease is cured. A creature that fails three of these saves gains a random form of [[../Dread#Indefinite Dread|indefinite dread]].
# Sewer Plague
*Disease*  
This disease is a catchall name for a swath of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant waters. It can be also transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.

**Trigger:** When a Humanoid comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by sewer plague, it must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or become infected. Every hour a creature spends wading through or otherwise in contact with sewage, refuse, or stagnant water, it has a 50 percent chance of becoming infected, without requiring a save. At the GM’s discretion, creatures native to sewers or swamps might also transmit this disease through Bite or Claw attacks.

**Effects:** Fatigue and muscle cramps manifest 1d4 days after infection. When the disease manifests, the infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion. After the disease manifests and until it is cured, the infected creature regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and regains no hit points after finishing a long rest. After finishing a long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 CON save. On a failure, the creature suffers one level of exhaustion. On a success, its exhaustion decreases by one level.

**Resolution:** If a successful save reduces an infected creature’s level of exhaustion to zero, it recovers from the disease. Alternatively, an infected creature can be cured by the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Restoration|restoration]] spell or similar magic.
# Sight Rot
*Disease*  
This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.

**Trigger:** When a Beast or Humanoid drinks water contaminated with sight rot, it must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or become infected.

**Effects:** One day after infection, the creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is permanently blinded until its sight is restored.

**Resolution:** An infected creature can be cured with an ointment made from the eyebright flower, which grows in swamps. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of the ointment prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely. A creature that has proficiency with herbalist tools can turn one eyebright flower into one dose of ointment with 1 hour of work. A creature blinded by sight rot can have its sight restored by the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Restoration|restoration]]* spell or similar magic.
