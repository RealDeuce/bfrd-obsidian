When PCs witness terrors beyond mortal comprehension, they might be inflicted with dread.
# Accruing Dread
Various magical effects, diseases, and supernatural hazards can inflict dread on an otherwise stable mind. Resisting a dread-inducing effect usually requires a WIS or CHA save, but specific effects can detail how to avoid or overcome dread effects.
# Curing Dread
A *[[../Spellcasting/Spells/Calm Emotions|calm emotions]]* spell can suppress the effects of dread while a *[[../Spellcasting/Spells/Restoration|restoration]]* spell can rid a creature of a short-term or long-term dread effect. Depending on the source of the dread, the *[[../Spellcasting/Spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]]* spell might also prove effective. A *[[../Spellcasting/Spells/Greater Restoration|greater restoration]]* spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of an indefinite dread effect.
# Dread Effects
Dread effects can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Simple horrors typically impose short-term dread effects, which last for just a few minutes. More horrific encounters or cumulative exposure can result in long-term or indefinite dread effects.
* A character afflicted with short-term dread is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Dread table for 1d10 minutes.
* A character afflicted with long-term dread is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Dread table for 1d10 × 10 hours.
* A character afflicted with indefinite dread gains a roleplaying flaw from the Indefinite Dread table that lasts until cured.
