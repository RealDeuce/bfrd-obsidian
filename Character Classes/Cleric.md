# Spellcasting
*1st-Level Cleric Feature*  
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast Divine spells.
## Cantrips
At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Divine spell list to learn. You choose more Divine cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric Progression table.
## Preparing Spells
You must prepare spells in advance before you can cast them. You can prepare any spell on the Divine spell list from circles for which you have Divine spell slots. (You determine which spell slots you can access by checking your level on the **Cleric Progression** table). You can choose a number of spells equal to your WIS modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). This is your list of prepared spells from which you can cast.

Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell circle for each spell you change. You can change your list of prepared spells as part of a long rest.
# Casting Spells
You have prepared a number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Divine spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher.

The **Cleric Progression** table shows how many Divine spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 3rd level, you have four 1st-circle and two 2nd-circle spell slots, and with a 16 WIS, you can have six prepared spells of 1st or 2nd circle, in any combination. You only have two spell slots for 2nd-circle spells though, so if you prepare only 2nd-circle spells, you won’t be able to use your 1st-circle spell slots at all.

Casting a spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells, it just uses up a spell slot. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.
## Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability. Your WIS modifier determines the save DC and the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:  
* **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier  
* **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier
## Rituals
You can also cast a type of long-form spell called a ritual. Rituals don’t need to be prepared, and they don’t use up spell slots.

At 1st level, choose one ritual from the Divine ritual list. You learn more rituals at higher levels, as shown in the Rituals Known column of the **Cleric Progression** table, but only from a circle for which you have spell slots. Rituals you learn don't count against the number of spells you learn at each level.
# Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your Divine spells.
# Manifestation of Faith
*1st-Level Cleric Feature*  
Clerics demonstrate their faith in one of two primary ways, wielding it as a holy warrior or calling it as a miracle worker. Choose how you manifest your faith with one of the following.

**Manifest Might.** You gain proficiency with heavy armor and one type of martial weapon of your choice. In addition, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy: once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal additional radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to your PB.

**Manifest Miracles.** You learn one additional cantrip of your choice from any source of magic. This cantrip counts as a Divine cantrip for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of cantrips you know. In addition, you can add your PB to the damage you deal with any Divine cantrip.
# Channel Divinity
*2nd, 6th, 13th, and 18th-Level Cleric Feature*  
You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity to produce effects beyond spells. You start with one effect: Turn the Profane. Some subclasses grant additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in their descriptions.

When you use your Channel Divinity feature, choose which specific effect you want, such as Turn the Profane. Some of these effects require a save, and in those cases, the DC is equal to your cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity feature once until you finish a short or long rest, then twice between rests at 6th level, three times at 13th level, and four times at 18th level. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all expended uses.
## Channel Divinity: Turn the Profane
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer to censure unholy creatures. Each Fiend and Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you and that can see or hear you must make a WIS save. If the creature fails its save, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must try to move as far away from you as it can, though it can’t first get closer to you to do it. On its turn, it can use only the Dash action or otherwise try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, it can use the Dodge action. It can’t take any reactions.
# Cleric Subclass
*3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Cleric Feature*  
Choose a subclass that reflects your relationship to your deity, Life, Light, or War (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you spells and other features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
## Domain Spells
Each cleric subclass has a list of domain spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that circle (as shown on the **Cleric Progression** table). Once you gain such a spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare. However, casting a domain spell still expends a Divine spell slot as normal.

If one of these spells isn’t on the Divine spell list, it still counts as a Divine spell for you.
# Improvement
*4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Cleric Feature*  
Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature):
* Increase a single ability score by 2.
* Increase two different ability scores by 1 each.
* Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the magic talents list.
# Destroy the Profane
*5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, and 17th-Level Cleric Feature*  
When a Fiend or Undead fails its save against your Turn the Profane feature, it is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating (CR) is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy the Profane table.
###### Destroy the Profane
| Cleric Level | Destroys Fiends or Undead of CR... |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 5th | 1/2 or lower |
| 8th | 1 or lower |
| 11th | 2 or lower |
| 14th | 3 or lower |
| 17th | 4 or lower |
# Divine Intervention
*9th-Level Cleric Feature*  
You can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. At the start of your turn, you can request aid from your deity by rolling a d20 and adding your PB. If the result is 19 or lower, your request fails, and your deity doesn't intervene. If the result is 20 or higher, your deity intervenes on your behalf, imbuing you with a fraction of their power.

If your deity intervenes, you can immediately use your action to cast any spell with a casting time of 1 action from the Divine spell list or your domain spell list, regardless of preparation rules. Casting a spell in this way doesn't expend a spell slot and doesn’t require material components. If the spell is of a higher circle than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC for this check equals 10 + the spell’s circle. On a failed check, the spell fails, your deity’s power fades, and your action is lost.

Alternatively, on a successful intervention, your GM can propose the form of the intervention. Anything that replicates the effects of a Divine spell is appropriate. In this instance, you still use your action but don’t cast a spell. You have final say on allowing the GM to pursue this option or choosing your own spell.

If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 1 week. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
# Heroic Boon
*10th-Level Cleric Feature*  
Your commitment to the cleric’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:
* **Gift of Consecration.** You are now immune to disease, poison damage, and the poisoned condition. If you die, your body is instantly preserved as per the gentle repose spell for up to a year and a day.
* **Gift of Wrath.** Choose either the radiant or necrotic damage type. You are now resistant to damage of the chosen type. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals damage of any type, you can choose for it to deal radiant or necrotic damage instead (you choose which each casting).
# Epic Boon
*20th-Level Cleric Feature*  
Your commitment to the cleric’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:
*  **Divine Herald.** When you use your Divine Intervention feature, your deity automatically intervenes without a roll, and you no longer have to wait a week before you use Divine Intervention again, though you can still use it only once per long rest. You are still bound by the other restrictions of the feature.
