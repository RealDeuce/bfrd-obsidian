This section lists the effects available for mechanists to learn and use with their Augment feature. Each option lists the type of item required for the effect to function and provides a description of how the effect works. Any effects that require an action to activate their properties can be activated with the Use an Object action.

Some effects require you to make an attack roll or require your target to make a save. The attack bonus and save DC for these is calculated as follows:  
$\quad$**Augment save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your Intelligence (INT) modifier  
$\quad$**Augment attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your Intelligence (INT) modifier
# Adhesive
*Item Requirement: Large or Smaller Equipment or Object that Isn’t Being Worn or Held*  
You imbue an item with the ability to stick to surfaces. While the item is within 30 feet of you, you can use an action to speak a command word and affix the item to a solid surface it is touching. The chosen surface can’t be part of a creature.

While affixed, the item can support up to 1,000 pounds of weight. If additional weight is added, the item detaches from the surface (falling or moving as appropriate).

A creature can spend an action to attempt to remove the affixed item with a STR (Athletics) check. The DC for this check equals 8 + your PB + your INT modifier. If a creature succeeds on this check, the item detaches from the surface.

If the item isn’t forcefully detached, it remains attached for 24 hours or until you use an action to detach it. If the item is detached by any means, its adhesive properties can’t be activated again until you finish a long rest.
# Collapsible
*Item Requirement: Large or Smaller Item that Isn’t Being Worn, Held, or Fixed in Place*
You imbue an item with the ability to become smaller. While you touch the item, you can use an action to reduce its size. When you do so, the target is halved in all dimensions, its weight is reduced to 1/8 of normal, and it decreases its size category by one, such as from Medium to Small. The target’s size can’t be reduced further by multiple uses of this feature. As an action, you can touch the target and cause it to return to its original size.

***At Higher Levels.*** Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, you can affect Huge or smaller items that meet the other requirements.
# Detecting
*Item Requirement: Goggles, Glasses, Spyglass, or Similar Equipment or Object with a Transparent Surface*  
You imbue an item with magical capabilities to enhance perception. While you touch the item, you can use an action to activate one of the listed effects. You must equip, wear, or actively look through the augmented item to gain the benefit of the chosen effect:
* **Darkvision.** You gain darkvision out to a range of 30 feet.
* **Invisi-Vision.** You can see invisible creatures and items as if they were visible. You are also aware of any creatures within 30 feet of you or if any creatures come within 30 feet of you, regardless of lighting conditions.
* **Magic Vision.** You gain the benefits of the detect magic spell within 30 feet of you.
* **X-Ray Vision.** You gain the ability to see through solid material within 30 feet of you. To you, solid items within that radius appear transparent and don’t prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block your vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.

While the augmented item is activated, you can use an action to deactivate it or switch the type of vision the item bestows. You can keep the item activated for up to 1 minute, all at once or in several shorter spans, each one using a minimum of 6 seconds (1 round) from the duration. The effect fully recharges when you finish a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, the range of all vision effects increases to 60 feet.
# Empowered
*Item Requirement: Weapon*
You imbue a weapon with offensive power. The weapon gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. If it wasn’t already magical, it is now. If it was already magical, this bonus stacks with any existing bonuses.

***At Higher Levels.*** Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, the attack and damage bonus increases to +2. At 15th level, it becomes +3.
# Illusive
*Item Requirement: Large or Smaller Item*
You imbue an item with the ability to mask its true appearance. While you touch the target, you can use an action to cause the item to appear as a different item of the same size and general composition. You can’t use this feature to change a target’s overall nature. For instance, a vehicle must always appear as another kind of vehicle, and equipment must appear as some other kind of equipment. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The change in appearance doesn't hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this effect to make a sharpened sword seem dull, anyone who touched the blade would be harmed as if they touched a fine-edged blade.

To discern whether an item is disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect the item and must succeed on an INT (Investigation) check against your augment save DC.

***At Higher Levels.*** Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, you can affect Huge or smaller items.
# Loading
*Item Requirement: Weapon with the Ammunition Property*  
You imbue an item with the ability to conjure magic ammunition. When you wield the weapon, an appropriate piece of ammunition magically appears in place as you attack. Any damage dealt by this ammunition is considered magical.

If you use this effect on a weapon with the Loading property, you don’t need to spend any time reloading the weapon.
# Phosphorescent
*Item Requirement: Small or Smaller Item that Can Be Worn or Held*  
You imbue an item with the ability to glow. While the item is on your person, you can use an action to cause the item to emit bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. When you first activate the item, you can choose whether this light shines normally or whether it can only be seen by a number of creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you. The maximum number of creatures you can include equals your INT modifier. The light can be any color you choose.

You can cause the item to stop emitting light at any time (no action required).

***At Higher Levels.*** Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, the radius increases to bright light in a 30‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can choose for the bright light to be sunlight.
# Propulsive
*Item Requirement: Armor (not Shields) or Small or Smaller Object that Can Be Worn*  
You imbue an item with the ability to increase the wearer’s speed. While wearing the augmented item, your base movement speed is increased by 5 feet.

In addition, while you wear the item, you can use an action to move vertically up to 10 feet and remain suspended there for up to 1 minute. You can repeat this action on subsequent turns, rising up to an additional 10 feet each time you do so.

While suspended, you can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed item or surface within reach (such as a wall or ceiling), which allows you to move as if you were climbing. When this effect ends or you choose to end it (no action required), you float gently to the ground if you are still aloft, and you can’t activate this Augment effect again until you finish a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, the movement speed bonus increases to 10 feet. At 15th level, it becomes 20 feet.
# Protean
*Item Requirement: Weapon*  
You imbue a weapon with the ability to change its damage type. When you successfully deal damage with the augmented weapon, you can replace the weapon’s damage type with another type of your choice. Damage altered in this way is always considered magical for purposes of overcoming resistances and immunities.

You can use this augment effect a number of times equal to your PB and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
# Reactive
*Item Requirement: Large or Smaller Item that Isn’t Being Worn, Held, or Fixed in Place*  
You imbue an item with the ability to detect specific triggers and react in one of several ways. While you touch the item, you can use an action to set or change the item’s trigger and reaction.

You can set the item to trigger when a creature you specify comes within 30 feet of it. This can be a specific creature you have met, such as “Jon the messenger,” a general visual description, such as “anyone wearing a city watch uniform,” or a creature type, such as “Celestials.” Your GM has final say on what is reasonable for a trigger.

When triggered, you instantly become mentally aware that the item has been triggered, and the item can react in one of the following ways. At your GM’s discretion, an item might be able to react in other comparable ways:

**Recording.** The item begins to record everything it can “see” and “hear” within 60 feet of it for the next hour, perceiving as a creature with typical vision or hearing could. After 1 hour, the item ceases to record new information and stores the recording until the item is no longer augmented or until you use an action to set a new trigger or reaction. While a recording is stored, you or any creature of your choosing can touch the item to mentally see and hear anything contained in the recording.

**Sound.** The item emits a sound for up to 1 minute that can be heard to a range of 60 feet (you choose quality and range), such as the sound of ringing bells or a set of bird calls. Alternatively, you can cause it to emit a pre-determined message of 25 words or less in your own voice.

***At Higher Levels.*** Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, the item can react when a specified creature comes within 60 feet of it.
# Reinforced
*Item Requirement: Item with Hit Points*  
You fortify an item. The target’s hit points and hit point maximum increase by an amount equal to 5 × your mechanist level. If the item is destroyed while this effect is active, the effect ends.
# Returning
*Target: Equipment or Object that Can Fit in the Hand and Isn’t Being Worn or Held*  
You imbue an item with the ability to return to your hand. While the augmented item is within 60 feet, you can cause it to instantly teleport into your hand (no action required). You must have at least one hand free for this ability to function.

***At Higher Levels.*** Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, you can affect an item up to 120 feet away from you. At 15th level, you can affect an item anywhere on the same plane as you.
# Repellant
*Item Requirement: Shield*  
You imbue an item with the ability to repel attackers. When a Large or smaller creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force the target to make a STR save against your augment save DC. On a failure, the creature is pushed 15 feet away from you. If the creature encounters a solid surface (like a wall) before moving the full amount, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning for each 10-foot increment it moved.

***At Higher Levels.*** Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, a target that fails its save is pushed 30 feet away from you.
