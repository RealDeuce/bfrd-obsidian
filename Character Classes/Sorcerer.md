# Font of Magic
*1st-Level Sorcerer Feature*  
You begin to draw from an internal wellspring of magic. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.
## Sorcery Points
You start with 2 sorcery points at 1st level, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Progression table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown in the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.
## Flexible Casting
You can sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points or use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.

**Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.** As a bonus action, you can expend one Arcane spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the spell slot’s circle.

**Creating Spell Slots.** You can spend sorcery points to gain one Arcane spell slot as a bonus action on your turn.
The **Creating Spell Slots** table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given circle. You can create spell slots no higher than 5th circle with this feature, and the spell slots you create vanish when you finish a long rest.
###### Creating Spell Slots
| Spell Slot Circle | Sorcery Point Cost |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 1st | 2 |
| 2nd | 3 |
| 3rd | 5 |
| 4th | 6 |
| 5th | 7 |
# Spellcasting
*1st-Level Sorcerer Feature*  
As a conduit for arcane power, you can cast Arcane spells.
## Cantrips
At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Arcane spell list to learn. You choose more Arcane cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the **Sorcerer Progression** table.
## Casting Spells
You know a small number of spells and can cast any of them by using an Arcane spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time.

The **Sorcerer Progression** table shows how many spells you know and how many Arcane spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 3rd level, you have four 1st-circle slots and two 2nd-circle slots. If you know the 1st-circle spell magic missile and have a 1st-circle and a 2nd-circle spell slot available, you can cast *magic missile* using either slot. If you use a 1st-circle slot, you have three 1st-circle slots remaining.

You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.
## Spells Known of 1st Circle and Higher
*At 1st level, choose two 1st-circle spells from the Arcane spell list to learn.*  
The Spells Known column of the **Sorcerer Progression** table shows when you learn additional Arcane spells. Each spell you choose must be from a circle for which you have Arcane spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level as a sorcerer, you can learn one new Arcane spell of 1st or 2nd circle.

In addition, when you gain a level of sorcerer, you can choose one Arcane spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Arcane spell list. The replacement spell must be of a circle for which you have Arcane spell slots.
## Spellcasting Ability
Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability. Your CHA modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:  
$\quad$**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier  
$\quad$**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier
## Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Arcane spells.
# Metamagic
*2nd, 6th, 13th, and 18th-Level Sorcerer Feature*  
You gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs in the moment. You start with two of the following Metamagic feature options of your choice. You gain another option at 6th, 13th, and 18th levels.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. To alter a spell with metamagic, a spell must count as an Arcane spell for you.

When your sorcerer level grants you the Improvement feature, you can replace one Metamagic option you know with a different Metamagic option from this list.
## Careful Spell
When you cast a spell that forces creatures to make a save, you can spend 1 sorcery point to exclude some of them from the effect. When you do, choose a number of those creatures up to half your sorcerer level (rounded up). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its save and takes no damage from the spell.

You can use the Careful Spell option even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
## Distant Spell
When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to increase its range by 100 feet. Spells with a range of touch instead have their range increased to 30 feet.
## Empowered Spell
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of damage dice up to your CHA modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new roll results.

You can use the Empowered Spell option even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
## Enlarged Spell
When you cast a spell with a range of self that affects an area (not a specific target), you can spend 3 sorcery points to increase the size of the spell’s area of effect in one of the following ways (depending on the shape of the spell effect):
* Circle, Cylinder, or Sphere. The radius of circle, sphere, or circular base of the cylinder increases by 5 feet. For example, the *darkness* spell could be altered to affect a 20-foot-radius sphere (instead of a 15-foot-radius sphere).
* Cone. The cone’s size increases by 15 feet. For example, the *burning hands* spell could be altered to affect a 30-foot cone (instead of a 15-foot cone).
* Cube. The length of each cube face increases by 5 feet. For example, the *thunderwave* spell could be altered to affect a 20-foot cube (instead of a 15-foot cube).
* Line. The length of the line increases by 15 feet. For example, the *lightning bolt* spell could be altered to affect a 115-foot line (instead of a 100-foot line).
## Extended Spell
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to increase its duration to 10 minutes. Spells with a duration of 10 minutes or longer instead have their duration doubled, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
## Flexible Spell
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change the spell’s damage type to any other damage type, except psychic. Spells that naturally deal psychic damage can't benefit from the Flexible Spell option.
## Heightened Spell
When you cast a spell that forces a target to make a save to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first save made against the spell.
## Hunting Spell
When you cast a spell that requires a target to make a save or take damage, you can spend 2 sorcery points to cause the spell to deal half damage even if a target succeeds on its save. This damage still affects targets who could normally avoid taking all damage on a successful save (via Evasion or similar features).
## Lucky Spell
When you cast a spell that requires an attack roll and miss, you can spend 2 sorcery points to add the total number of Luck that you currently have to the attack roll, potentially turning a failure into a success. Luck isn’t expended by this Metamagic option and can subsequently be spent on the attack roll normally.
## Quickened Spell
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. You can’t use this feature to cast two 1st-circle or higher spells on the same turn.
## Retain Spell
When you cast a spell that requires concentration, you can spend 2 sorcery point to have advantage on any concentration checks made to maintain the spell for its duration. Your concentration isn’t automatically broken for that spell if you become incapacitated, meaning that you can still attempt concentration checks as you normally would.

You can use the Retain Spell option even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
## Shielding Spell
When you cast a spell, you can spend 2 sorcery points to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 3 × the spell’s circle. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.
## Subtle Spell
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.
## Twinned Spell
When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to 1 + the spell’s circle to target a second creature in range with the same spell. (Cantrips cost only 1 sorcery point.)

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current circle. For example, *magic missile* and *scorching ray* aren’t eligible but *acid arrow* and *ray of enfeeblement* are.
# Sorcerer Subclass
*3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Sorcerer Feature*  
Choose a subclass that reflects the origins of your magical power, either Chaos or Draconic (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you spells and other features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
## Origin Spells
Each sorcerer subclass has a list of origin spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that circle (as shown in the **Sorcerer Progression** table). Once you gain such a spell, it is always on your list of known spells and doesn’t count against the number of spells you know. However, casting an origin spell still expends an Arcane spell slot as normal.

If one of these spells isn’t on the Arcane spell list, it still counts as an Arcane spell for you. You can’t replace origin spells when you gain a level of sorcerer.
# Improvement
*4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Sorcerer Feature*  
Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature):
* Increase a single ability score by 2.
* Increase two different ability scores by 1 each.
* Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the magic talents list.
# Sorcerous Renewal
*5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th-Level Sorcerer Feature*  
When you finish a short rest, roll 1d4 + 1 and regain that many sorcery points.

At higher levels, your Sorcerous Renewal feature improves: you roll 2d4 + 1 at 9th level, 3d4 + 1 at 13th, and 4d4 + 1 at 17th.
# Heroic Boon
*10th-Level Sorcerer Feature*  
Your commitment to the sorcerer’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:
* Arcane Instruction. You find new ways to tap into internal magical resources. When you fail an ability check, you can spend 1 sorcery point to add your CHA modifier to the result, potentially turning a failure into a success.
* Innate Spell. You learn one spell of 1st or 2nd circle from the Arcane, Primordial, or Wyrd spell list. You can cast that spell at its lowest circle by expending a number of sorcery points equal to that spell’s circle instead of using a spell slot. When you gain a level in sorcerer, you can replace your innate spell with another spell of 1st or 2nd circle from the available lists.
# Devour Spell
*14th-Level Sorcerer Feature*  
When a creature you can see targets you with a spell, you can use your reaction to attempt to immediately draw the spell’s power into yourself. Make a CHA check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s circle. On a success, you and every other target of the spell have advantage on saves against it and take only half as much damage from it. You also gain a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s circle.

Alternatively, you can target a magical effect within 30 feet of you that was created by a spell, such as *fog cloud* or *wall of fire*. On a successful CHA check, the spell ends.

Once you successfully devour a spell, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 4 sorcery points to do so.
# Epic Boon
*20th-Level Sorcerer Feature*  
Your commitment to the sorcerer’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:
* Arcane Conjunction. When a spell or magical effect affects you, you can use your reaction to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. That creature is affected as though it were also the target. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you spend 10 sorcery points to do so.
