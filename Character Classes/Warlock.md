# Eldritch Blast
1st, 5th, 9th, and 14th-Level Warlock Feature  
As a result of binding yourself to otherworldly powers, you can conjure a baleful magical energy. As an action, you can send a beam of crackling eldritch power toward a creature within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

Upon achieving higher levels of warlock, you can create more than one beam: two beams at 5th level, three at 9th, and four at 14th. You can direct the beams at the same or different target. You make a separate attack roll for each beam.
# Pack Boon
*1st-Level Warlock Feature*  
The initial pact that grants you your warlock powers is sealed with the gift of a Pact Boon. You gain one of the following boons of your choice.
## Pact of the Blade
You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You have proficiency with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you attack with the weapon, you can use your CHA modifier, instead of STR or DEX, for attack and damage rolls.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform an existing weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short or long rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears when you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.
## Pact of the Chain
You learn a more potent version of the *[[../Spellcasting/Rituals/Find Familiar|find familiar]]* ritual and can cast it without the need for any material components. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. A familiar summoned with this feature has the following differences from a standard familiar summoned by the spell:
* When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal familiar forms or one of the following special forms: **[[../Monsters/Monsters/Blink Dog|blink dog]]**, **[[../Monsters/Monsters/Imp|imp]]**, **[[../Monsters/Monsters/Pseudodragon|pseudodragon]]**, or **[[../Monsters/Monsters/Quasit|quasit]]**.
* You can telepathically communicate or see through your familiar’s eyes as long as it is on the same plane as you, ignoring the standard 100-foot range restriction. In addition, while perceiving through your familiar’s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.
* Your familiar can attack. In combat, your familiar shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.
## Pact of the Tome
You receive an eldritch grimoire called a Book of Shadows. You can use your Book of Shadows as a spellcasting focus for your spells. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any source spell list (they don’t have to be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips. These cantrips count as Wyrd spells for you.

If your Book of Shadows is lost or destroyed, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to create a replacement. The replacement contains any spells previously transcribed within it. This ceremony can be performed as part of a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous grimoire—if it still exists. The book is unreadable by anyone but you, and it is instantly destroyed when you die.
# Eldritch Invocations
*2nd-Level Warlock Feature*  
In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations. These fragments of forbidden knowledge imbue you with magical abilities that abide beyond any mere spell duration

You gain two eldritch invocations of your choice, though you must meet any prerequisites. Invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. At certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock Progression table.

In addition, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one invocation you know and replace it with another invocation that you meet the prerequisites for.
# Spellcasting
*2nd-Level Warlock Feature*  
Your eldritch power deepens, giving you the ability to cast Wyrd spells.
## Cantrips
At 2nd level, choose two cantrips from the Wyrd spell list to learn. You choose more Wyrd cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock Progression table.
## Casting Spells
You know a small number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Wyrd spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time.

The **Warlock Progression** table shows how many spells you know and how many spell slots you have per day at a given level. For example, at 5th level, you have four 1st-circle slots and two 2nd-circle slots. If you know the 1st-circle spell *bane* and have a 1st-circle and a 2nd-circle spell slot available, you can cast *bane* using either slot. If you use a 1st-circle slot, you have three 1st-circle slots remaining. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.
## Spells Known of 1st-Circle and Higher
At 2nd level, choose two 1st-circle spells from the Wyrd spell list to learn.
The Spells Known column of the **Warlock Progression** table shows when you learn additional Wyrd spells. Each spell you choose must be from a circle for which you have Wyrd spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level as a warlock, you can learn one new Wyrd spell of 1st or 2nd circle.

In addition, when you gain a level of warlock, you can choose one Wyrd spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Wyrd spell list. The replacement spell must be of a circle for which you have Wyrd spell slots.
## Spellcasting Ability
Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability. Your CHA modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:  
$\quad$**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier  
$\quad$**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier
## Spellcasting Focus
You can use a wyrd focus as a spellcasting focus for your Wyrd spells.
# Warlock Subclass
*3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Warlock Feature*  
Choose a subclass that reflects the type of entity that becomes your patron, either Fiend or Reaper (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you spells and other features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
## Pact Spells
Each warlock subclass has a list of pact spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that circle (as shown in the **Warlock Progression** table). Once you gain such a spell, it is always on your list of known spells and doesn’t count against the number of spells you know. However, casting a pact spell still expends a Wyrd spell slot as normal.

If one of these spells isn’t on the Wyrd spell list, it still counts as a Wyrd spell for you. You can’t replace pact spells when you gain a level of warlock.
## Pact Magic
Your patron gives you access to a special reservoir of power called Pact Magic. You can expend one use of Pact Magic to cast any Pact Spell you know without expending a spell slot, though they are always treated as cast at the highest‑circle warlock spell slot you can access (see **Warlock Progression**).

You can use this feature twice, whether casting the same or different spells from your Pact Spells. You gain additional uses of Pact Magic at higher warlock levels: at 13th level, you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests.

You regain all expended uses of Pact Magic when you finish a short or long rest.
# Improvement
*4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Warlock Feature*  
Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature):
* Increase a single ability score by 2.
* Increase two different ability scores by 1 each.
* Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the magic talents list.
# Enhanced Boon
*6th-Level Warlock Feature*  
Your patron enhances your Pact Boon as a reward for your service. You gain one of the following enhancements as determined by your chosen Pact Boon. If you have more than one Pact Boon, choose which one is enhanced.

**Pact of the Blade.** You can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn.

**Pact of the Chain.** When you complete a short or long rest, your familiar gains temporary hit points equal to your PB + your CHA modifier. In addition, when you make an attack against a creature within 5 feet of your familiar, your familiar can use its reaction to give you advantage on the attack roll.

**Pact of the Tome.** You can now inscribe rituals into your Book of Shadows. Choose two rituals of 1st or 2nd circle (in any combination) from the Wyrd ritual list. The rituals appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen rituals.

On your adventures, you can add other Wyrd rituals you find to your Book of Shadows if a ritual’s circle is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each circle of the ritual, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.
# Heroic Boon
*10th-Level Warlock Feature*  
Your commitment to the warlock’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:
* **Echoes of Knowledge.** You learn one 1st-circle and one 2nd-circle spell of your choice from any spell list, they count as Wyrd spells for you. The chosen spells can’t be rituals, and they don’t count against your total spells known. These spells are added to your list of Pact Spells and can be cast by expending a use of Pact Magic or by expending Wyrd spell slots as normal.
* **Echoes of Power.** When you successfully hit with one of your Eldritch Blast beams and roll a 10 on the damage die, you can roll the d10 again and add the result as extra force damage dealt by that beam.
# Patron’s Favor
*18th-Level Warlock Feature*  
You can call upon your patron’s power by expending a use of your Pact Magic feature to cast any spell you know of 5th-circle or lower from any spell list.
# Epic Boon
*20th-Level Warlock Feature*  
Your commitment to the warlock’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:
* **Eldritch Master.** If you start your turn with no uses of Pact Magic remaining, you can beseech your patron to immediately restore all expended uses (no action required). You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
