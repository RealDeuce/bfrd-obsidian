# Martial Arts
*1st-Level Monk Feature*  
You have mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the Two-handed or Heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:
* You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the **Monk Progression** table.
* You can use DEX instead of STR for attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
* When you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take from the attack by 1d10 + your DEX modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile or thrown weapon if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.
# Unarmored Defense
*1st-Level Monk Feature*  
While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your DEX modifier + your WIS modifier.
# Techniques
*2nd-Level Monk Feature*  
Your training gives you access to special techniques that allow you to amplify and manipulate the energy within yourself and the environment. Your ability to use this energy is represented by technique points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Technique Points column of the **Monk Progression** table.

You can spend these points to fuel various techniques. You start knowing three techniques: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more technique features as you gain levels in this class.

You recover expended technique points when you finish a short or long rest. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your technique points.

Some of your techniques require your target to make a save to resist the technique’s effects. The save DC is calculated as follows:  
$\quad$**Technique save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier
## Flurry of Blows
Immediately after you use an action on your turn, you can spend 1 technique point to make two unarmed strikes or make one attack with a monk weapon as a bonus action.
## Patient Defense
You can spend 1 technique point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.
## Step of the Wind
You can spend 1 technique point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. When you do so, your jump distance is doubled until the start of your next turn.
# Unarmored Movement
*2nd-Level Monk Feature*  
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk Progression table.
# Monk Subclass
*3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Monk Feature*  
Choose a subclass that reflects your method for connecting with the energies of the universe, either Flickering Dark or Open Hand (detailed at the end of this class). Your subclass grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
# Improvement
*4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Monk Feature*  
* Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature):
* Increase a single ability score by 2.
* Increase two different ability scores by 1 each.
* Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the martial talents list.
# Multiattack
*5th-Level Monk Feature*  
Your physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action.
# Stunning Strike
*5th-Level Monk Feature*  
You can interfere with the flow of energy in an opponent’s body. Once per turn, when you successfully hit another creature with an unarmed strike or monk weapon, you can spend 1 technique point to attempt to stun your foe. When you do so, the target takes damage from your attack as normal and then it must succeed on a CON save or be stunned until the end of your next turn. Each time a stunned target takes damage, it can repeat the save, ending the stunned effect on a success.
# Empowered Strikes
*6th-Level Monk Feature*  
Your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
# Evasion
*6th-Level Monk Feature*  
You can dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a DEX save to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the save and only half damage if you fail.
# Perfect Motion
*9th-Level Monk Feature*  
While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield, you gain the following benefits:
* When you fall, you can use your reaction to reduce any falling damage you would take by an amount equal to 5 × your monk level.
* You can move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. If you end your movement or if your movement is interrupted while you are standing on a vertical surface or on liquid, you fall as normal.
# Heroic Boon
*10th-Level Monk Feature*  
Your commitment to the monk’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:
* **Purity of Body.** Your mastery of the energy flowing through your body makes you immune to disease, poison damage, and the poisoned condition. In addition, when you are reduced to 0 HP but not killed outright, you can instantly reset your hit point total to your current number of technique points. You can’t recover hit points in this way again until you finish a long rest.
* **Purity of Mind.** The clearness of your mind gives you advantage on Wisdom saves. As a bonus action, you can end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.
# Astral Teachings
*13th-Level Monk Feature*  
As an action, you can expend 2 technique points to become proficient in one language, skill, tool, or weapon of your choice until you are incapacitated or use this feature again.
# Diamond Soul
*14th-Level Monk Feature*  
Your mastery of energy grants you proficiency in all saves. In addition, when you make a save and fail, you can spend 1 technique point to reroll it. You must take the second result.
# Timeless Self
*17th-Level Monk Feature*  
Your spirit sustains you, body and mind. You gain the following benefits:
* You can’t be magically aged and suffer none of the frailty of old age. You can still die of old age, however.
* You no longer need food or water.
* Your ability scores and hit point maximum can’t be lowered or reduced by any means short of a wish spell.
# Empty Body
*18th-Level Monk Feature*  
You can use your action to spend 4 technique points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage. In addition, you can spend 8 technique points to cast the astral projection spell as an action (ignoring the standard casting time), without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.
# Epic Boon
*20th-Level Monk Feature*  
Your commitment to the monk’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:
* Boundless Technique. When you roll for initiative, you regain up to 4 expended technique points. If you start your turn with no technique points remaining, you regain 2 technique points.
