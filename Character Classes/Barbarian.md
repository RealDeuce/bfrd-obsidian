# Rage
*1st-Level Barbarian Feature*  
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:
* You have advantage on STR ability checks and saves.
* When you make a melee weapon attack using STR, you gain a bonus to the damage roll, which increases as you gain levels as a barbarian (as shown in the Rage Damage column of the **Barbarian Progression** table). The damage type of this extra damage matches that of the weapon used to deal it.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you can cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature or taken damage from a hostile creature since the start of your last turn. You can also end your rage early with a bonus action on your turn.

You can rage a number of times equal to the number listed in the **Barbarian Progression** table. You regain all expended uses of Rage when you finish a long rest.
# Unarmored Defense
*1st-Level Barbarian Feature*  
While you aren't wearing any armor, your AC equals 13 + your CON modifier. (DEX doesn't factor into your AC for this class feature.) You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
# Danger Sense
*2nd-Level Barbarian Feature*  
You gain an uncanny sense of impending danger, giving you an edge when avoiding harm. You have advantage on DEX saves while you aren't blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.
# Reckless Attack
*2nd-Level Barbarian Feature*  
You can throw aside concern for defense in favor of ferocious attack. When you make an attack on your turn, you can decide to do it recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using STR during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until the start of your next turn.
# Barbarian Subclass
*3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Barbarian Feature*  
Choose a subclass that reflects the path you walk, either Berserker or Wild Fury (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
# Improvement
*4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Barbarian Feature*  
Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature):
* Increase a single ability score by 2.
* Increase two different ability scores by 1 each.
* Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the martial talents list.
# Fast Movement
*5th-Level Barbarian Feature*  
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor. In addition, when you roll initiative, you can immediately move up to half your speed.
# Multiattack
*5th-Level Barbarian Feature*  
Your physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action.
# Feral Instinct
*6th-Level Barbarian Feature*  
Your honed instincts give you advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, if you enter a rage before doing anything else on that turn.
# Brutal Critical
*9th, 13th, and 17th-Level Barbarian Feature*  
You score a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20 with melee weapons and unarmed strikes. You also roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This extra damage increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.
# Heroic Boon
*10th-Level Barbarian Feature*  
Your commitment to the barbarian’s path grants you a powerful ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:
* Instant Rage. You can rage (no bonus action required) when you roll initiative and use your Fast Movement feature, if you have at least one use of Rage left to expend.
* Stubborn Rage. Your rage ends only when its duration expires, you fall unconscious, or you choose to end it.
# Relentless Rage
*14th-Level Barbarian Feature*  
Your rage lets you shrug off even lethal wounds. While raging, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can make a DC 10 CON save. On a success, you don't fall unconscious until your current rage ends. You still make death saves and can be killed outright if you take damage from a single source equal to your hit point maximum. Even if you fail three death saves during your rage, you only die if you end your turn with 0 hit points.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.
# Unyielding Might
*18th-Level Barbarian Feature*  
You have perfected the application of might and mettle. You gain the following benefits:
* When you make an ability check or save using STR or CON, treat any d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
* Your melee weapon attacks deal additional damage, equal to your STR score, to objects and structures.
# Epic Boon
*20th-Level Barbarian Feature*  
Your commitment to the barbarian’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:
* Primal Champion. You embody untamed power. Your STR and CON scores each increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.
