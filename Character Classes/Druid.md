# Spellcasting
*1st-Level Druid Feature*  
As a conduit for primordial power, you can cast Primordial spells.
## Cantrips
At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Primordial spell list to learn. You choose more Primordial cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the **Druid Progression** table.
## Preparing Spells
You must prepare spells in advance before you can cast them. You can prepare any spell on the Primordial spell list from circles for which you have Primordial spell slots. (You determine which spell slots you can access by checking your level on the **Druid Progression** table). You can choose a number of spells equal to your WIS modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). This is your list of prepared spells from which you can cast.

Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell circle for each spell you change. You can change your list of prepared spells as part of a long rest.
## Casting Spells
You have prepared a number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Primordial spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher.

The **Druid Progression** table shows how many Primordial spell slots you have per day at a given level. For example, at 3rd level, you have four 1st-circle and two 2nd-circle spell slots, and with a 16 WIS, you can have six prepared spells of 1st or 2nd circle, in any combination. You only have two spell slots for 2nd-circle spells though, so if you prepare only 2nd-circle spells, you won’t be able to use your 1st-circle spell slots at all.

Casting a spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells, it just uses up a spell slot. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.
## Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability. Your WIS modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:  
$\quad$**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier  
$\quad$**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier
## Rituals
You can also cast a type of long-form spell called a ritual. Rituals don’t need to be prepared, and they don’t use up spell slots.

At 1st level, choose one ritual from the Primordial ritual list. You learn more rituals at higher levels, as shown in the Rituals Known column of the **Druid Progression** table, but only from a circle for which you have spell slots. Rituals you learn don't count against the number of spells you learn at each level.
## Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your Primordial spells.
# Druidic
*1st-Level Druid Feature*  
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use a system of natural elements to leave hidden messages that only other druids will understand. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful WIS (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.
# Nature’s Gift
*1st-Level Druid Feature*  
You have learned to harness the ambient energy of nature and can redirect that energy to encourage growth and healing. As a bonus action, choose one creature within 5 feet of you (this can be you). When you do so, roll a number of d4s equal to your PB (minimum of 2d4). That creature regains hit points equal to the total rolled. This feature has no effect on Constructs or Undead.

You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your PB. You recover expended uses when you complete a long rest.
# Wild Shape
*2nd, 6th, 13th, and 18th-Level Druid Feature*  
You gain the ability to channel energy directly from nature to produce effects beyond spells. You start with two effects: Beast Form and Draw Power. Some subclasses grant additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in their descriptions.

When you use your Wild Shape feature, simply choose which specific effect you want, such as Beast Form. Some of these effects require a save, and in those cases, the DC is equal to your druid spell save DC.

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape feature once until you finish a short or long rest, then twice between rests at 6th level, three times at 13th level, and four times at 18th level. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all expended uses.
## Wild Shape: Beast Form
As an action, you can magically assume the form of a Beast. When you first gain this feature, choose two Beasts of challenge rating (CR) 1/4 or less as your known forms. To select a known form, you must have seen or interacted with a Beast in your past. For example, a druid that hails from a desert environment is unlikely to be familiar enough with a sea-dwelling creature like a dolphin to select it as a known form. The Beast you choose can’t have any legendary actions or lair actions.

As you advance in druid levels, you can choose more beast forms as shown in the Beast Forms Known column of the
## Druid Progression table.
When you gain a level of druid, you can replace one known form with a different form of your choosing. Any new form you choose must abide by the form restrictions.
## Wild Shape: Draw Power
As a bonus action, you can reshape the natural energies around you to draw them within yourself and recharge your spellcasting ability. When you do so, choose a single expended Primordial spell slot to recover. The recovered spell slot must be of a circle equal to or less than your proficiency bonus (PB). For example, a 5th-level druid with a PB of +3 could recover an expended 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-circle Primordial spell slot with this feature.

You can’t use Draw Power while transformed by the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature, even if you have multiple uses of Wild Shape available to expend.
# Druid Subclass
*3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Druid Feature*  
Choose a subclass that reflects your values and magical practices, either Leaf or Shifter (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you spells and other features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
### Ring Spells
Each subclass has a list of ring spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that circle (as shown on the **Druid Progression** table). Once you gain such a spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare. However, casting a ring spell still expends a Primordial spell slot as normal.

If one of these spells isn’t on the Primordial spell list, it still counts as a Primordial spell for you.
# Improvement
*4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Druid Feature*  
Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature):
* Increase a single ability score by 2.
* Increase two different ability scores by 1 each.
* Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the magic talents list.
# Improved Beast Form
*5th, 9th, and 14th-Level Druid Feature*  
You can now use the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature to assume more powerful beast forms. When you learn a new form, you can choose a Beast of CR 1/2 or less.

At 9th level, you can assume the form of any Beast of CR 1 or less. At 14th level, you can assume the form of any Beast of CR 2 or less.
# Heroic Boon
*10th-Level Druid Feature*  
Your commitment to the druid’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:
* **Rite of the Kingdom.** All Beasts and creatures with the Animal tag understand your speech, and you can understand their noises and motions as if they were speaking, even if they don't speak a language. This ability doesn’t grant Beasts the intelligence to understand or communicate complex concepts, but you can share basic information with ease. Your GM has final say on what a particular creature can express. In addition, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with or influence such creatures.
* **Rite of the Shaper.** When you roll initiative and have no remaining uses of Wild Shape, you regain one use. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you complete a long rest.
# Nature’s Grace
*17th-Level Druid Feature*  
Your attunement to the natural energies of the world infuses your body, sustaining you and protecting you from unnatural harm. You gain the following benefits:
* You can’t be magically aged, and you suffer none of the frailty of old age. You can still die of old age though.
* You no longer need food or water to survive.
* Your ability scores and hit point maximum can’t be lowered by any means short of a wish spell.
# Epic Boon
*20th-Level Druid Feature*  
Your commitment to the druid’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:
* **Archdruid.** You can use the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature an unlimited number of times. In addition, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of Primordial spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost.
