# Eyes of the Maker
*1st-Level Mechanist Feature*  
When you touch a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use it, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has (if any). You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.
# Shard of Creation
*1st-Level Mechanist Feature*  
You learn how to craft a shard of creation, which is a Tiny magical object with many uses that appears on your person. In its base state, the shard appears as a constantly shifting, fluid-like bundle of plasma.

The shard vanishes instantly if you are slain or if it is not in your possession for more than 24 consecutive hours. If the shard is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ritual to create a replacement. This ritual can be performed as part of a short or long rest.

The shard has a number of charges equal to your INT modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended charges when you finish a long rest. Charges can be spent to activate the following properties.
## Inspire
When you make an ability check while touching the shard (regardless of its current form), you can spend 1 charge to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to your check result.
## Transform
While touching the shard, you can use an action to transform it into any type of nonmagical weapon or shield or into any object of Medium size or smaller. The object appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, but the chosen space must contain a surface or liquid capable of supporting the object. If the object you create is of an appropriate size to be worn or held, you can choose for the object to appear in your hand or on your person. The total value (in gold pieces) of an object created can’t be more than 20 × your mechanist level.

A transformed shard remains in its new form until you die, use an action to return it to its original state, or use an action to transform it again. No matter what shape the shard assumes, those who handle the shard can sense something strange about its nature. The shard can’t be passed off as a typical item for purposes of buying and selling.
# Augment
*2nd-Level Mechanist Feature*  
You gain the ability to channel magical energy into items. To use this ability, you must spend 1 hour focusing on the item that you wish to augment while remaining in physical contact with it (which can be done as part of a short or long rest).

You gain two augment effects of your choice. Augment effect options are detailed at the end of the class description. At certain mechanist levels, you gain additional augment effects of your choice, as shown in the Augment Effects Known column of the **Mechanist Progression** table.

When you use this ability, choose an effect from those you know. Regardless of the effect, an augmented item is considered a magic item while the effect remains active. You can apply these effects to existing magic items, and any bonuses or features granted by an augment effect stack with any properties a magic item already possesses.

Unless specified otherwise, a chosen effect lasts indefinitely, but as an action, you can touch an item to end an ongoing effect that you created. You can have effects active on multiple items, provided you spend the required time focusing on each item individually. However, an item can only bear one effect at a time. Multiple uses of the same effect don’t stack.

The maximum number of items you can affect with this feature at one time is listed in the Augmented Items column of the **Mechanist Progression** table. If you try to exceed your maximum, you must choose an ongoing effect to end.

You can also augment your transformed shard of creation, provided its form meets the requirements for the chosen effect. The effect remains with the shard when it transforms as long as the new form remains compatible—if not, the effect immediately ends.
# Efficient Action
*2nd-Level Mechanist Feature*  
Your mechanical expertise allows you to use items more efficiently in the chaos of battle. You can use a bonus action to take the Use an Object action or to perform a weapon option.
# Mechanist Subclass
*3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Mechanist Feature*  
Choose a subclass that reflects your relationship to your craft, either Metallurgist or Spellwright (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
# Improvement
*4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Mechanist Feature*  
Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature):
* Increase a single ability score by 2.
* Increase two different ability scores by 1 each.
* Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from either the martial or the technical talents list.
# Multiattack
*5th-Level Mechanist Feature*  
Your physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action.
# Rapid Augment
*6th-Level Mechanist Feature*  
You can now use your Augment feature more rapidly. As a bonus action, you can touch an item and imbue it with a known augment effect of your choice. You remain bound by all other restrictions of the Augment feature, including number of items.

You can use your Rapid Augment feature a number of times equal to your INT modifier and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
# Greater Creation
*9th-Level Mechanist Feature*  
Your growing insight into the nature of reality allows you greater control over your Shard of Creation feature. You receive the following enhancements to its given properties.
## Inspire
Your bonus to ability checks is now 1d8 (instead of 1d6).
## Transform
You can now transform the shard into any Large or smaller tool or nonmagical object. All other restrictions still apply, including the limit on the gold piece value.
# Heroic Boon
*10th-Level Mechanist Feature*  
Your commitment to the mechanist’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:
* **Curse of Unmaking.** As an action, you can make a melee spell attack using your augment attack modifier (see **Augment Effects**) against a creature or item within reach. On a successful hit, the target becomes cursed so that it is vulnerable to all damage. If the target is a creature, it can attempt a CON save against your augment save DC (see **Augment Effects**) each time it takes a new instance of damage, ending the curse on a success. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
* **Mend the Broken.** As an action, you touch a creature or item and cause it to magically regain a number of hit points equal to 5 × your mechanist level. This effect also repairs any catastrophic damage suffered by the target, such as lost limbs, missing parts, or other harm that would ordinarily be irreparable. If the item doesn’t have a hit point total, your touch restores it to working order as best it can with the pieces available. This feature can’t restore expended charges on magic items or restore magical properties to nonmagical items that were once magical. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
# Engineer’s Insight
*13th-Level Mechanist Feature*  
As long as you have at least 1 minute of uninterrupted focus on a task, when you make an ability check, treat any d20 roll of 9 or lower as though you rolled a 10.

Normal activity like moving doesn’t interrupt focus, but attacking, taking damage, or participating in anything that requires initiative order does interrupt focus.
# Ranged Augment
*14th-Level Mechanist Feature*  
You can now use your Rapid Augment feature on items you can see within 60 feet of you. (You no longer need to touch them.)

In addition, if an effect from your Augment feature would typically require you to touch the item to activate its properties, you no longer need to do so as long as the item is within 60 feet of you. You don’t need to see the item to activate its properties in this way.
# Always Prepared
*17th-Level Mechanist Feature*
When you would take damage from an attack, you can use a reaction to take the Use an Object action.
# Perfect Creation
*18th-Level Mechanist Feature*  
Your growing insight into the nature of reality allows you greater control over your Shard of Creation feature. You receive the following enhancements to its given properties.
## Inspire
Your bonus to ability checks is now 1d10 (instead of 1d8).
## Transform
You can now transform the shard into any item—including structures and vehicles—of Huge size or smaller. You are no longer bound by any cost restrictions when choosing a form.
# Epic Boon
*20th-Level Mechanist Feature*  
Your commitment to the mechanist’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:
* **Creative Engine.** You gain a +1 bonus to your saves for each effect from your Augment feature currently active on items within 60 feet of you. If you fail a save while any of those items are within 60 feet of you, you can automatically end one of those effects (your choice) to succeed on the save instead.
