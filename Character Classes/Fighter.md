# Last Stand
*1st-Level Fighter Feature*  
When you take damage that would reduce your hit points to less than half your hit point maximum (rounded down), you can use your reaction to spend hit dice, up to a number equal to your PB. Immediately roll those hit dice. You regain hit points equal to the sum of all dice rolled + your CON modifier.
# Martial Action
*1st-Level Fighter Feature*  
Your tactical expertise allows you to act quickly on the battlefield. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat to perform a weapon option or one of the martial actions granted by this feature.

Choose one of the following martial actions that you know.
## Aim
*Requires Wielding a Ranged or Thrown Weapon*  
As a bonus action, you take the time to increase the effectiveness of your next ranged weapon attack. Select one target you can see. If you make a ranged weapon attack against that target before the end of your turn, double your PB for the first attack roll.
## Guard
*Requires Wielding a Shield*  
As a bonus action, you raise your shield to intercept incoming attacks. Select one enemy creature within 5 feet of you. That creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against you or an ally within 5 feet of you before the start of your next turn.
## Quick Strike
*Requires Wielding Two Light Weapons*  
After you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a different Light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand—instead of the one attack typically granted by two-weapon fighting. Don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of these additional attacks unless the modifier is negative.
## Wind Up
*Requires Wielding a Heavy or a Versatile Melee Weapon with Both Hands*  
As a bonus action, you ready a powerful attack against a nearby target. Select one target you can see within 10 feet of you. If you hit that target with a melee weapon attack before the end of your turn, the first such attack deals extra damage equal to your PB (of the same damage type as the weapon).
# Action Surge
*2nd, 13th, and 18th-Level Fighter Feature*  
When the need is great, you push your body to its absolute limit. On your turn, you can activate this feature to gain another action—in addition to the action and possible bonus action you regularly get on your turn.

Once you use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 13th level, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on the same turn. At 18th level, you can use it three times before a rest but only once on the same turn
# Fighter Subclass
*3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Fighter Feature*  
Choose a subclass that reflects your role in battle, either Spell Blade or Weapon Master (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
# Improvement
*4th, 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th-Level Fighter Feature*  
Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature):
* Increase a single ability score by 2.
* Increase two different ability scores by 1 each.
* Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the martial talents list.
# Multiattack
*5th, 9th, and 17th-Level Fighter Feature*  
Your physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action.

Starting at 9th level, you can make three attacks when you take the Attack action. At 17th level, you can make four.
# Heroic Boon
*10th-Level Fighter Feature*  
Your commitment to the fighter’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:
* **Defiant.** When you fail a save, you can instead choose to succeed on the save. You can use this feature once and regain the use of it when you finish a long rest. You can use it twice before a long rest at 13th level, and three times at 17th.
* **Unstoppable.** When you start your turn, you can choose to end one of the following conditions affecting you: blinded, charmed, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, or stunned. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
# Epic Boon
*20th-Level Fighter Feature*  
Your commitment to the fighter’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:
* **Turn the Tide.** Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature or object with a weapon attack on your turn, you can cause the attack to deal additional damage (of the same damage type as the weapon) equal to your STR or DEX score (your choice). The attack’s damage ignores resistance and immunity, and it can’t be reduced or avoided by any means.
