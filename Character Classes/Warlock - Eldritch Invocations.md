This section lists the eldritch invocations available for warlocks to learn. If an invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

If a prerequisite lists a level requirement, that is the minimum warlock level required (you can take it at higher warlock levels).
