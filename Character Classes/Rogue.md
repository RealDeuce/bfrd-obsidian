# Expertise
*1st and 6th-Level Rogue Feature*  
Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency. Double your PB for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, choose two more of your proficiencies (any combination of skills or tools) to gain this benefit.
# Sneak Attack
*1st-Level Rogue Feature*  
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The weapon you use must have the Finesse property or be a ranged weapon.

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of your extra damage you deal increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the **Rogue Progression** table.
# Thieves’ Cant
*1st-Level Rogue Feature*  
During your rogue training, you learned Thieves’ Cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature who knows Thieves’ Cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey a message in Thieves’ Cant than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.
# Cunning Action
*2nd-Level Rogue Feature*  
Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
# Rogue Subclass
*3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Rogue Feature*  
Choose a subclass that represents your specialized set of skills, either Enforcer or Thief (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
# Improvement
*4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Rogue Feature*  
Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature):
* Increase a single ability score by 2.
* Increase two different ability scores by 1 each.
* Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the technical talents list.
# Uncanny Dodge
*5th-Level Rogue Feature*  
When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the attack’s damage against you by half.
# Evasion
*6th-Level Rogue Feature*  
You can dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a DEX save to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the save and only half damage if you fail.
# Reliable Talent
*9th-Level Rogue Feature*  
You have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. When you make an ability check with a skill, tool, or vehicle that you have proficiency with, treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as if you rolled a 10.
# Heroic Boon
*10th-Level Rogue Feature*  
Your commitment to the rogue’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:
* **Escape Artist.** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make any kind of save (including DEX saves) to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the save and only half damage if you fail.
* **Jack of All Trades.** When you gain a new talent, you can choose it from any talent list. Immediately gain one talent of your choice (that you meet the prerequisites for) when you gain this feature.
# Precise Critical
*13th and 17th-Level Rogue Feature*  
You score a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20 with ranged weapons and weapons with the Finesse property. In addition, you can roll one additional weapon damage die (not an additional Sneak Attack die) when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ranged weapon attack or attack made with a Finesse weapon.

This extra damage increases to two additional dice at 17th level.
# Keensense
*14th-Level Rogue Feature*  
You have keensense to a range of 10 feet. Your keensense ceases to function while you are deafened or otherwise deprived of hearing.
# Elusive
*18th-Level Rogue Feature*  
You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. While you aren’t incapacitated, attack rolls can’t have advantage against you, regardless of the source of advantage.
# Epic Boon
*20th-Level Rogue Feature*  
Your commitment to the rogue’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:
* Stroke of Luck. You have got it when it counts. If your attack misses a target within normal range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
