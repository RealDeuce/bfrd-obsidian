# Arcane Recovery
*1st-Level Wizard Feature*  
You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day, when you finish a short rest, you can recover expended Arcane spell slots of your choice. Recovered spell slots can have a combined circle total equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up).

For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two circles’ worth of spell slots. So you could choose to recover either a single 2nd-circle spell slot or two 1st- circle spell slots.
# Spellcasting
*1st-Level Wizard Feature*  
As a student of Arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.
## Cantrips
At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Arcane spell list to learn. You choose more Arcane cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard Progression table.
## Spellbook
At 1st level, your spellbook contains six 1st-circle Arcane spells of your choice. It is the repository of all the Arcane spells you know—except for your cantrips, which are so simple and well-rehearsed that you don’t even need to write them down.
## Preparing Spells
You must prepare spells in advance before you can cast them. You can prepare any spell in your spellbook for which you have Arcane spell slots. (You determine which spell slots you can access by checking your level on the **Wizard Progression** table.) You can choose a number of spells equal to your INT modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). This is your list of prepared spells from which you can cast.

Preparing a new list of spells requires time studying your spellbook and re-memorizing incantations and gestures: at least 1 minute per spell circle for each spell you change. You can change your list of prepared spells as part of a long rest.
## Casting Spells
You have prepared a number of spells and can cast any of them by using an Arcane spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher.

The **Wizard Progression** table shows how many Arcane spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 3rd level, you have four 1st-circle and two 2nd-circle spell slots, and with a 16 INT, you can have six prepared spells of 1st or 2nd circle, in any combination. You only have two spell slots for 2nd-circle spells though, so if you prepare only 2nd-circle spells, you won’t be able to use your 1st-circle spell slots at all.

Casting a spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells, it just uses up a spell slot. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.
## Learning Spells of 1st Circle and Higher
Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two Arcane spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each spell must be of a circle for which you have Arcane spell slots, as shown on the **Wizard Progression** table. During your adventures, you might also find other Arcane spells to add to your spellbook.
## Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence (INT) is your spellcasting ability. Your INT modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:  
$\quad$**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your INT modifier  
$\quad$**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your INT modifier
## Rituals
You can also cast a type of long-form spell called a ritual. Rituals don’t need to be prepared, and they don’t use up spell slots.

At 1st level, choose one ritual from the Arcane ritual list. You learn more rituals at higher levels, as shown in the Rituals Known column of the **Wizard Progression** table, but only from a circle for which you have spell slots. Rituals you learn don't count against the number of spells you learn at each level.

Rituals are contained in your spellbook alongside your regular spells, and new rituals written on spell scrolls can be copied into your spellbook like normal Arcane spells.
## Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Arcane spells.
# Magic Sense
*2nd-Level Wizard Feature*  
You learn to perceive magical workings. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect magical forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of creatures with spellcasting ability, ongoing spell effects, or magic items within 30 feet of you. If the magical effect is the result of an ongoing spell, you learn which school of magic the spell belongs to.

This sense can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB + 1. When you finish a long rest, you regain all uses.
# Wizard Subclass
*3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Wizard Feature*  
Choose a subclass that reflects your specialized field of magical study, either Battle Mage or Cantrip Adept (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
# Improvement
*4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Wizard Feature*  
Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature):
* Increase a single ability score by 2.
* Increase two different ability scores by 1 each.
* Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the magic talents list.
# Rote Spell
*5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th-Level Wizard Feature*  
Your continued practice of spellcraft has honed your mind, allowing you to affix a limited number of spells—called rote spells—in your mind. Choose one 1st-circle Arcane spell from your spellbook, and that spell is now a rote spell. You always have a rote spell prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare during a long rest. Casting a rote spell still uses a spell slot as normal.

Over the course of 8 hours or as part of a long rest, you can exchange one rote spell for a different Arcane spell of the same circle contained in your spellbook.

At higher levels, you can select more rote spells: you choose a 2nd-circle Arcane spell to become a rote spell at 9th level, a 3rd-circle Arcane spell at 13th, and a 4th-circle Arcane spell at 17th.
# Superior Recovery
*6th-Level Wizard Feature*  
When you use your Arcane Recovery feature, you can choose to swap out a number of prepared Arcane spells with different Arcane spells from your spellbook—in addition to recovering Arcane spell slots. You can swap out a number of prepared spells equal to half your PB (rounded down) in this way.
# Heroic Boon
*10th-Level Wizard Feature*  
Your commitment to the wizard’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:
* **Rite of the Ritualist.** When you learn a new ritual as part of gaining a level of wizard, you can choose it from any source of magic. In addition, you can now copy ritual spells from any source of magic into your spellbook. Any rituals gained in this way count as Arcane spells for you.
* **Rite of the Source Master.** Choose the Divine, Primordial, or Wyrd source of magic. When you add new spells to your spellbook as part of gaining a level of wizard (including the level you gain this feature), you can choose spells from the Arcane spell list or spells from your chosen source. Each spell must be a of a circle for which you have spell slots. In addition, you can now copy spells of your chosen source into your spellbook. Any spells gained in this way count as Arcane spells for you.
# Spellguard
*14th-Level Wizard Feature*  
Your knowledge of magic allows you to better assess the intentions and power of hostile spells and spell attacks, increasing your chance to avoid their effects. You have advantage on saves against spells and resistance to damage dealt by spells and spell attacks.
# Spell Mastery
*18th-Level Wizard Feature*  
You can cast each of your rote spells at their lowest circle once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a rote spell, you can’t cast that same spell in this way again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast any of your rote spells at a higher circle, you must expend an Arcane spell slot as normal.
# Epic Boon
*20th-Level Wizard Feature*  
Your commitment to the wizard’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:
* **Archmage.** When you cast a spell of 1st circle or higher and that spell expends an Arcane spell slot, you can choose to roll a d10. If the number rolled is higher than the circle of the expended spell slot, you automatically recover that slot. For example, if you expend a 1st- circle spell slot, a result of 2 or higher on the d10 means that you recover that 1st-circle spell slot. Once you successfully recover a spell slot in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you complete a short rest.
