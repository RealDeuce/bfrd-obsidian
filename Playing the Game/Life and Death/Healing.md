Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a *cure wounds* spell or a *potion of healing* can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid heals a ranger for 8 HP. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains only 6 HP, not 8.

A creature that dies can’t regain hit points until magic such as the *revivify* spell has restored it to life.
# Hit Dice
Every PC has a number of hit dice equal to their character level. Hit dice are a measure of a character’s personal fortitude and allow you to heal yourself without magical assistance during a short rest.

The size of your hit dice depends on your class levels. Wizards have a d6, while barbarians have a d12.
# Resting
Heroic though they might be, adventurers need rest—time to sleep, eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and prepare for further adventure.

Adventurers can take short rests during an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.
## Short Rest
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

You can spend one or more hit dice at the end of a short rest, up to your maximum number of hit dice (which is equal to your character’s level). For each hit die spent in this way, roll the die, and add your character’s CON modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional hit die after each roll until you run out of hit dice. You regain some spent hit dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained in the **Long Rest** section.
## Long Rest
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the character must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, you regain all lost hit points up to your hit point maximum. You also regain spent hit dice, up to half of your maximum (minimum of 1). For example, if your character has 8 hit dice, you regain 4 of them upon finishing a long rest.

A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
