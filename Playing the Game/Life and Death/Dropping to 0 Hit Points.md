When you drop to 0 HP, you either die outright or fall unconscious and are dying. These rules are primarily used during initiative in an encounter. In rare instances, character death can occur outside of an encounter, especially through dangers covered in the Other Forms of Harm section. The GM decides how these rules function in deadly situations that occur outside of initiative.
# Death
Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 HP and more damage remains to be taken, keep track of it. Your character is **dead** when you are at 0 HP and have either failed three death saves or taken as much damage as your hit point maximum while at 0 HP. Magical healing or a WIS (Medicine) check can’t help you at this point. Only a spell like *revivify* or *resurrection* can bring the character back to life.

For example, a cleric with a hit point maximum of 12 currently has 6 HP. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 HP, and 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.
## Death Saves
When you start your turn with 0 HP, you must make a special save, called a **death save**, to determine whether you creep closer to death or cling to life. Unlike other saves, a death save isn’t tied to any ability score.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed on the death save. Otherwise, you fail. An individual success or failure has no immediate effect. However, on your third success, you become stable. On your third failure, you die.

Successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both resets to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.

***Rolling 1 or 20.*** When you make a death save and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point and are conscious again, no longer needing to make death saves.

***Damage at 0 HP.*** If you take any damage while you have 0 HP, you suffer an automatic death save failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you die instantly.
# Dying
If damage reduces you to 0 HP and doesn’t kill you, you are dying. **Dying** is when you are at 0 HP and must make a death save at the start of your next turn. You have the unconscious condition. If you gain hit points while dying, you stop dying. Your unconscious condition ends, but you are still prone.
# Stable
The best way to help a creature with 0 HP is to heal it. Barring that, the creature can at least be stabilized. You are **stable** when you are at 0 HP and don't need to make a death save. You still have the unconscious condition. Becoming stable wipes the slate clean of successes and failures on death saves.

You can use your action to try to stabilize a dying creature with a successful DC 10 WIS (Medicine) check. A stable creature remains at 0 HP and is still unconscious, but it doesn’t make death saves and is not in imminent danger of death. If the creature takes any damage while stable, it returns to dying and must start making death saves again if it takes any damage.

A stable creature that isn’t healed but takes no more damage regains 1 hit point and ends the unconscious condition after 1d4 hours.
# Monsters and Death
Monsters generally die the instant they drop to 0 HP, since tracking death saves for a dozen monsters can be tedious.

Mighty villains and special NPCs are common exceptions, though. The GM can decide to have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as PCs if it better suits the story.
