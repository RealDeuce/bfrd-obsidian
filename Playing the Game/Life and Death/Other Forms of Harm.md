While damage is the most common form of harm, other effects can bring short-term or long-term harm to PCs.
# Conditions
Many monster attacks, spells, and other dangers impose **conditions** on PCs. A condition, such as blinded, charmed, or frightened, can hinder a creature without damaging it. Depending on its source, a condition can last for a few seconds or until a magical cure is found.

Pay special attention to exhaustion—that condition can outright kill a PC and is often inflicted by environmental hazards and other forms of harm.
# Curses
Curses are supernatural afflictions that magically hamper or alter their victims. Objects, creatures, and even areas can be the target of a curse. Most curses can be ended through use of a *remove curse* spell, *greater restoration* spell, or similar magic. Some curses, like those that come with cursed magic items, are only temporarily suppressed by spells like *remove curse*. The most powerful curses can be broken only by performing specific actions or triggering narrative effects specific to the curse.
# Diseases
Diseases are physical afflictions that can be contracted from some monsters, hazards, or exposure to necromantic magic. A disease typically ravages its victim over multiple days, causing more damage the longer it is left untreated. While common diseases might be cured with a WIS (Medicine) check, spells like *restoration* and similar magic are often required to cure more potent diseases.
# Dread
When PCs witness terrors beyond mortal comprehension, they might be inflicted with dread. Dread goes beyond standard fear. It is severe psychological harm that can scar a creature for minutes or indefinitely until magical intervention is used.
# Poisons
Poisons are tools used by PCs and monsters to cause harm or injury.
# Starvation and Dehydration
Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.
## Food
A typical character needs to eat one pound of food per day. You can make food last longer by eating half rations. Eating half rations in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + CON modifier (minimum 1). Beyond that, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of each day they haven’t eaten.

One normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.
## Water
A character needs one gallon of water per day or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character who drinks even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has at least one level of exhaustion, the character suffers two levels each day with little or no water.
# Suffocating
Most creatures, particularly most PCs, need to breathe air to survive. When a creature can’t breathe, such as while submersed in water, it must hold its breath.

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its CON modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its CON modifier (minimum of 1 round). If it is still out of air at the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 HP and begins making death saves. The creature can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a CON modifier of +2 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 HP.
