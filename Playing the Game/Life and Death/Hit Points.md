Every creature has a number of **hit points** (HP) representing a combination of its physical and mental durability. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

At full health, a creature is at its **hit point maximum**. At any given moment, a creature’s **current hit points** can be any number from its hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage and receives healing.

Whenever your character takes damage, subtract that amount from its current hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.
# Temporary Hit Points
Some spells and special abilities give you **temporary hit points**. These are a buffer against damage, an extra pool of hit points that protects your current hit points.

When you take damage while you have temporary hit points, subtract the damage amount from the temporary hit points first. Any leftover damage then carries over to your current hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the 5 temporary hit points and then take 2 damage to your current hit points.

Because temporary hit points are separate from your current hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. You can be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.

Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and you can’t stack temporary hit points together. If you have a pool of temporary hit points and then get more from another source, decide whether to keep the ones you have or take the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have 0 HP, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. If they absorb all the damage from a hit, you don’t have to fail a death save.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a listed duration, they last until depleted or you finish a long rest.
# Damage
The most common type of harm dealt to creatures is represented by damage. Different attacks, spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage.
# Damage Types
Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types are provided here, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

***Acid.*** The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

***Bludgeoning.*** Blunt force attacks, such as hammers, falling, and constriction, deal bludgeoning damage.

***Cold.*** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.

***Fire.*** Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

***Force.*** Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including *magic missile* and *spiritual weapon*.

***Lightning.*** A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.

***Necrotic.*** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain Undead and a spell such as grave touch, withers matter and even the soul.

***Piercing.*** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monster bites, deal piercing damage.

***Poison.*** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.

***Psychic.*** Mental abilities or abilities that assault the mind, such as an aboleth’s Psychic Bolt or a ghost’s Horrify, deal psychic damage.

***Radiant.*** Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s *flame strike* spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

***Slashing.*** Swords, axes, and claws deal slashing damage.

***Thunder.*** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the *thunderwave* spell, deals thunder damage.
# Damage Resistance and Vulnerability
Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or easy to hurt with certain damage types.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.
