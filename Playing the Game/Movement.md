Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all sorts of movement play into fantasy adventures.

The GM can summarize movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a large dungeon, the GM might summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.”

Sometimes though, it’s important to know more precisely how long it takes to get somewhere. Rules for this depend on a few factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.
# Speed
Every creature has one or more ways to move through the world, called **speed**. Speed is the distance a creature can cover with a move. On a character sheet or in monster statistics, speed is always listed with a number measured in feet.

All creatures have a base walking speed. Creatures that have no ground-based movement have a base walking speed of 0. In addition to base walking speed, creatures can have one or more of the following additional movement speeds.
## Burrowing
Creatures with a **burrowing speed** can move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A creature can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait for that.
## Climbing
Creatures with a **climbing speed** can move with ease on vertical surfaces. Unlike most creatures, a creature with a climbing speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement when climbing.
## Flying
A creature with a **flying speed** can use all or part of its movement to fly through the air. Most creatures with a flying speed must stay in continual motion to remain airborne, but some can hover. If a creature can hover, it is noted in parentheses after its flying speed.
## Swimming
Creatures with a **swimming speed** can move with ease in water or similar liquids. Unlike most creatures, a creature with a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement when swimming. In addition, creatures with a swimming speed don’t make melee weapon attacks at disadvantage while underwater.
# Special Movement Rules
Adventurers often find themselves traversing dangerous environments or navigating perilous situations that require special kinds of movement. PCs might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go. In such circumstances, the following special movement rules apply.
## Climbing
While climbing, you move at half speed—each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot. If you climb in difficult terrain, each foot of movement costs 2 extra feet. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds might require one or more successful STR (Athletics) checks. Failing such a check might cause a creature to fall.
## Crawling
While crawling, you move at half speed—each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot. If you crawl in difficult terrain, each foot of movement costs 2 extra feet.
## Jumping
Several factors determine how far and how high a creature can jump.

***Long Jump.*** When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to half your walking speed if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only a quarter of your walking speed. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs 1 foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At the GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 STR (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you attempt to land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 DEX (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

***High Jump.*** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your STR modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs 1 foot of movement. At the GM’s discretion, you might be able to make a STR (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.
## Swimming
While swimming, you move at half speed—each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot. At the GM’s discretion, gaining distance in rough water might also require a successful STR (Athletics) check. Failing such a check might cause a creature to start drowning. Certain weapons are also more difficult to use while swimming.
# Difficult Terrain
Adventurers often travel on rough ground: dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, and sheets of ice. Such areas are considered **difficult terrain**.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain. Moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed. If two or more sources of difficult terrain occur in the same space, you still move at only half speed.

Difficult terrain is often a natural part of the landscape, but some class features or spells, such as entangle, can create it for a short time. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.
# Forced Movement
Some effects or consequences move you against your will. Forced movement never provokes opportunity attacks from hostile creatures.
## Falling
Falling is a common adventuring hazard. At the end of a fall, a creature lands prone and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell (to a maximum of 20d6) unless it has a feature or trait that allows it to avoid taking damage from the fall. In most cases, falling happens so quickly that a creature takes the damage immediately.

If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its flying speed reduced to 0, or otherwise loses the ability to move, it immediately falls to the ground, unless it has the ability to hover or is held aloft by other means.
## Pulling and Pushing
Some effects such as a roper’s Reel bonus action or an ogre using a shove attack can pull or push you away from the source. A creature that has grappled you might also drag you with it during its move.
# Traveling
Traveling is the method of movement used when creatures journey across great distances for long periods of time. When traveling, use travel pace rules to abstract this kind of movement.
## Travel Pace
While traveling, the party collectively decides if they move at a fast, normal, or slow pace. Consult the **Travel Pace** table to find how far a group can move in a period of time for their pace, and whether traveling at the pace has any benefits or penalties. For example, a fast pace makes travelers less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully. Note that the **Travel Pace** table assumes a party is moving through normal terrain. If a party is traveling through difficult terrain, the distance they can travel is halved.

***Forced March.*** A standard travel pace assumes that you travel for 8 hours in a day. You can push beyond that limit at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, you cover the distance shown in the Hour column for your pace, and each character must make a CON save at the end of the hour.

The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed save, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.

***Mounts and Vehicles.*** For short time spans (up to 1 hour), many animals move much faster than Humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace on the table as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel up to 24 hours per day.
###### Travel Pace
| Pace | Per Minute | Per Hour | Per Day | Effect |
| ---- | ---------- | -------- | ------- | ------ |
| Fast | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles | −5 penalty to Perception score |
| Normal | 300 feet | 3 miles | 24 miles | — |
| Slow | 200 feet | 2 miles | 18 miles | Can use stealth |
