Fundamental adventuring tasks—noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy, and targeting a spell—rely heavily on a character’s ability to perceive the world around them.
# Vision and Obscured Areas
Creatures primarily perceive the world by sight. This is called vision. Creatures usually have secondary senses of hearing, smell, and touch that also allow them to interact with the environment, but vision is considered the “standard” primary sense.

Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance. Areas of darkness or other effects that interfere with vision are labeled as either lightly or heavily obscured.
## Lightly Obscured
In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on WIS (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
## Heavily Obscured
In a **heavily obscured** area, such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage, a creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area. A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
# Special Senses
In addition to basic vision, creatures can have one or more of the following additional senses.
## Darkvision
A creature with darkvision can see in darkness. Within darkvision range, the creature can see in dim light as if it were bright light and can see in darkness as if it were dim light. A creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
## Keensense
A creature with keensense can perceive its surroundings using a sense other than vision. Creatures without eyes typically have this sense, as do creatures with echolocation or an extraordinary sense of smell. If a creature has no other form of sensing, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its keensense defines the maximum range of its ability to perceive the world.
## Tremorsense
A creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the source of vibrations when it and the source are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense typically can’t detect flying or incorporeal creatures.
## Truesight
A creature with truesight can see in dim light, darkness, and magical darkness as if it were bright light. It also sees creatures and objects with the invisible condition, it automatically detects visual illusions and succeed on saves against them, and it perceives the true form of a creature with the Shapechanger tag or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane within truesight range.
