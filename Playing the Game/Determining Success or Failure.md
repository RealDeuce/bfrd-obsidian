In most cases, you measure your check result against a target number the GM sets for you, called a difficulty class (DC). If your check result is equal to or higher than the DC, your roll succeeds! If it’s less than the DC, you fail.
# Determining DC
Most of the time, the rules tell the GM what a DC should be. For example, a PC must get a check result of 19 or higher to successfully attack a creature with an AC 19 (AC is one example of a pre-determined DC).

When the rules don’t provide a DC, the GM sets an appropriate number. If you’re the GM and you aren’t sure, think about how hard you want a task to be. Then consult the **Typical Difficulty Class** table to assign a number. You can always set it at a number that isn’t divisible by 5.
###### Typical Difficulty Class
| Difficulty | Chance of Success           | DC           |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Easy       | High Chance of Success      | 10 or less   |
| Medium     | Moderate Chance of Success  | 15           |
| Hard       | Low Chance of Success       | 20           |
| Very Hard  | Almost No Chance of Success | 25 or higher |
