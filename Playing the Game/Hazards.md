**Hazards** are location-based threats as opposed to threats presented by creatures (though creatures can create or affect a hazard). Weather conditions can impose hazards like extreme heat or cold, or alter an areaâ€™s light or obscurement. Ambient magic is also frequently responsible for bizarre and fantastical hazards.

Four of the most common hazards are included here.
# Extreme Cold
*Hazard*  
Exposure to temperatures below 0 degrees Fahrenheit threatens creatures not adapted to the cold. The hazard is generally continual.

**Trigger:** This hazard begins when a creature is exposed to extreme cold for at least 1 hour. A creature avoids exposure if it is resistant or immune to cold damage, if it has natural adaptation to cold climates, or it is wearing dry winter clothing such as a heavy coat and furs, gloves, and a hat.

**Effects:** After the first hour, an exposed creature must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or gain one level of exhaustion. The creature must repeat this save at the end of each hour of continued exposure, increasing the DC by 1 for each hour of exposure beyond the first (DC 11 at 2 hours, DC 12 at 3 hours, etc.). Creatures have disadvantage on these saves if they are vulnerable to cold damage, wearing metal armor, wearing clothing not designed for winter conditions, or are wet.

**Resolution:** If an exposed creature is removed from the affected area or otherwise avoids exposure for at least 1 hour, the CON save made against this hazard resets to DC 10. Otherwise, this hazard ends once a creature leaves the affected area or environmental conditions significantly change.
# Extreme Heat
*Hazard*  
Exposure to temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit threatens creatures not adapted to the heat. The hazard is generally continual.

**Trigger:** This hazard begins when a creature is exposed to extreme heat for at least 1 hour. A creature avoids exposure if it is resistant or immune to fire damage, if it has natural adaptation to hot climates, or if it has access to twice its daily amount of required drinking water.

**Effects:** After the first hour, an exposed creature must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or gain one level of exhaustion. The creature must repeat this save at the end of each hour of continued exposure, increasing the DC by 1 for each hour of exposure beyond the first (DC 11 at 2 hours, DC 12 at 3 hours, etc.). Creatures have disadvantage on these saves if they are vulnerable to fire damage, wearing metal armor or Heavy armor, or wearing clothing not designed for hot climates.

**Resolution:** If an exposed creature is removed from the affected area or otherwise avoids exposure for at least 1 hour, the CON save made against this hazard resets to DC 10. Otherwise, this hazard ends once a creature leaves the affected area or environmental conditions significantly change.
# Gale Winds
*Hazard*  
Heavy gusting winds can appear with little warning, battering the weak and impairing many activities. Gale winds disperse fog, extinguish open flames, and make movement difficult for small and flying creatures. As a weather hazard, it is usually only minutes long, though in canyons or mountainous regions, it can be continual.

**Trigger:** This hazard begins when a creature enters an area affected by gale winds.

**Effects:** Gale winds impose disadvantage on ranged attacks and WIS (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. Small and Tiny creatures must succeed on a DC 11 STR save or fall prone at the start of each of their turns while in the area. A flying creature must land at the end of each turn spent in the area or make a DC 11 STR save. On a failure, the creature falls to the ground instantly and takes falling damage.

**Resolution:** An affected creature must find shelter or leave the area.
# Torrential Percipitation
*Hazard*  
Precipitation such as heavy rain or snowfall causes a variety of problems. It can last from minutes to days.

**Trigger:** This hazard begins when a creature enters an area affected by torrential precipitation.

**Effects:** Everything within the area is considered lightly obscured. A creature that starts its turn within torrential precipitation has disadvantage on WIS (Perception) checks. If the torrential precipitation is heavy rain, it extinguishes open flame. If it is heavy snowfall, the ground is difficult terrain.

**Resolution:** An affected creature must find shelter or leave the area.
