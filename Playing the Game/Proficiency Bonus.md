All PCs have a proficiency bonus (PB) determined by their level. Monsters also have this bonus incorporated into the various components of their stat blocks.

You only ever add your PB to a roll once. For example, if two different rules allow you to add your PB to a WIS save, you still add it only once.

Occasionally, you might double or halve your PB before you add it to a roll. If some circumstance suggests that your PB applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and double or halve it only once.

If your PB doesn’t apply to a roll, doubling doesn’t change that. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your PB when you make INT (History) checks.

In general, don’t double your PB for attack rolls or saves. If some feature or effect allows you to do so, the above rules still apply.
