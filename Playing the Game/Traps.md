Traps can be almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on unwary travelers. Detecting and disarming traps are your best defense against these troubles.
# Trap Types
A trap can be either mechanical or magical. Either kind can also be complex.
## Mechanical Traps
Mechanical traps include things that depend on a mechanism to operate, such as pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, and whirling blades.
## Magic Traps
Magic traps consist of magical devices that activate spell effects. Spells like *glyph of warding* and symbol function as magic traps.
## Complex Traps
Complex traps continue to execute on rounds after activation instead of triggering once and being done. For example, a trap that slowly floods a room is a complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.

Complex traps can start initiative and act independently in initiative order. On each of its turns, the trap takes an action, usually making successive attacks or maintaining an effect that changes over time. Until triggered, a complex trap can be detected and disabled like a standard trap.
# Detecting Traps
Every trap in the game has a specific way it can be detected, but a trap usually requires a PC to actively spot it with a WIS (Perception) check against the trap’s DC (set by the GM). Some basic traps can be automatically spotted with a high enough passive Perception score, but the deadliest traps often are hidden too well for passive detection. Your group’s travel pace can also reduce your ability to passively spot hidden dangers.
# Disarm Traps
If a PC detects a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it. Every trap has a specific way it can be disarmed (or avoided), but typically, disarming a trap requires a PC to succeed on a DEX (Thieves Tools) check against the trap’s DC (set by the GM). Complex traps might first require a successful INT (Investigation) check just to deduce the trap’s operation. Some magical traps require an INT (Arcana) check to detect or disarm and might even require a spell like *dispel magic* to disarm instead of thieves’ tools.
