When you want to do something that isn’t covered by an attack roll or save, make an ability check. Since ability checks are so wide-ranging, they are more complex than the other two types of checks.

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success. You overcome the challenge. Otherwise, it’s a failure. You make no progress toward the objective, or you make some progress but also suffer a setback, as determined by the GM.
# Contests
Sometimes your efforts are directly opposed by someone else. This can occur when multiple creatures try to do the same thing but only one can succeed, such as snatching a magic ring falling to the floor. It can also occur when one creature tries to prevent another one from accomplishing a goal—for example, a monster might try to force open a door while an adventurer holds it closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a **contest**.

Every participant in a contest makes an ability check. Apply appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, compare the check results to each other. The participant with the highest check result wins the contest and either succeeds at the action or prevents other participants from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same. Thus, one participant might win by default. If two creatures tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep it closed, a tie means that the door stays shut.
# Passive Checks
A passive check doesn’t involve any die rolls. This kind of ability check can represent an average outcome for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again. Or a GM can use it to secretly determine whether a PC succeeds at something the player doesn’t know to try to do, such as noticing a hidden monster.

A passive check total is called a **score**. Here’s how to determine a character’s passive score:
* 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check.
* If the character has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.

So, for example, if a 1st-level character has a WIS +2 ability modifier and is proficient in the Perception skill, they have a passive Perception score of 14 (10 + 2 for WIS modifier + 2 for PB).
# Working Together
Sometimes two or more creatures work together. In this case, the creature with the highest ability modifier is designated the lead for the effort. That creature can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help others give. In combat, a creature can only provide this kind of assistance by taking the Help action.

A creature can only provide help if they have capacity to do the task. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a creature who lacks that proficiency can’t provide help with a lock-picking job. Moreover, a creature can provide help only when their assistance would be productive. Threading a needle doesn’t get any easier with another pair of hands.
# Group Checks
When several individuals try to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group check. In this case, characters who are skilled at a task help cover for those who aren’t.

To make a group check, each member of the group makes the ability check separately. If at least half the members succeed (round up), the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.

Group checks don’t come up often, and they’re most useful when all characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers navigate a swamp, the GM might call for a WIS (Survival) group check to see if the whole party can avoid quicksand and sinkholes. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into a hazard.
# Relevant Proficiencies
Two main types of proficiencies can modify an ability check.
## Skill Proficiencies
Every PC starts the game with skill proficiencies granted by their background, class, heritage, lineage, or talents. Proficiency in a skill means you can add your PB to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, you don’t add your PB to ability checks.

For example, if a character attempts to climb a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a STR (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the player rolls a d20, adds their character’s STR modifier and then adds PB. If the character lacks that proficiency, the player rolls a d20 and adds only their character’s STR modifier.

The rules in a scenario usually prompt a GM to ask for an ability check using a specific skill. For example, “Make a WIS (Perception) check.” Sometimes though, more than one skill might reasonably apply. You can ask the GM if a different skill is relevant to the check. If the GM agrees, you can use that skill instead.

See the following **Skills** section for a full list of skill proficiencies and more information about their use.
## Tool Proficiencies
Some tasks require a particular tool to accomplish, such as repairing an item, forging a document, or picking a lock. Your background, class, heritage, lineage, or talents can give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your PB to any ability check you make using that tool.

Tool use isn’t tied to a single ability modifier. The check depends on what you’re trying to do, at the GM’s discretion. For example, when using construction tools, the GM might ask for a DEX (Construction Tools) check to carve out fine detail or a STR (Construction Tools) check to make something out of particularly hard wood.
