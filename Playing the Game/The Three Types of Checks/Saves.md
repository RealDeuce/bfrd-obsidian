Saves are checks made to resist or avoid threats from spells, traps, poisons, diseases, or similar hazards. The GM normally asks you to make a save because your character is at risk of harm. There are six types of saves in the game, each tied to one of the six ability scores: STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, or CHA.

To make a save, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, if your GM asks you to make a DEX save, roll a d20 and add your DEX modifier to find the check result.

The DC for a save is determined by the effect that calls for it. For example, when you make a save against a spell, the DC is determined by the caster’s relevant ability modifier and PB.

The consequences of success or failure are described after an effect’s DC. A successful save usually means that you suffer no harm, or partial harm, from an effect.
# Relevant Proficiencies
Your character class gives you proficiency in at least two saves. The wizard, for example, is proficient in INT and WIS saves. Talents and similar features can also give you proficiency with a certain type of save. Add your PB when you make a save you have proficiency with.
