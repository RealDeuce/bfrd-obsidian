Sometimes special circumstances allow you to roll a check with **advantage** or force you to roll a check with **disadvantage**.
* Rolling with advantage means that you roll two d20s, then use the higher of the two numbers to calculate your check result.
* Rolling with disadvantage means you roll two d20s, then use the lower of the two numbers to calculate your check result.
For example, if you have advantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 17. If you instead have disadvantage, use the 5.

If two or more favorable situations grant advantage, you still roll only one additional d20, and the same is true for disadvantage. You only ever roll a maximum of two d20s. If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, they cancel each other out, and you roll only one d20. This works no matter how many circumstances grant advantage or impose disadvantage. If they conflict at all, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and a rule lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and roll a 1 and a 13, you could reroll the 1 or the 13, but not both
