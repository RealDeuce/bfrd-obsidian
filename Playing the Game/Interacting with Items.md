A character’s interaction with items in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what happens.

For example, a character pulls a lever. The GM might say that this opens a chute causing a room to flood with water. Or it might open a secret door in a nearby wall.

If the lever is rusted in position though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a STR check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC based on the difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks. The GM determines an object’s AC and HP and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks (it’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example). Objects always fail STR and DEX saves, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 HP, it breaks.

A character can also attempt a STR check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.
# Types of Items
Certain rules, spells, and abilities affect items in different ways. In such scenarios, it’s often important to further define the item’s type. This section breaks down the various categories of items and provides examples of what kinds of items belong to each.
## Items
Items is the highest-level category. It includes almost everything that isn’t a creature or natural terrain. Items include equipment, objects, structures, and vehicles, and it’s a catchall for things that don’t fit neatly into another category.
## Equipment
The equipment category includes all items that can be **carried** or **wielded** by characters. Most weapons, armor, adventuring gear, tools, and magic items fall into this category. Typically, equipment doesn’t have AC or hit points, and it can’t be broken or damaged like other kinds of items.
## Objects
The object category includes all items that can’t be carried or wielded or items. Objects generally have an AC and hit points. Typically, objects can be broken. In many cases, it makes more sense to treat Huge or Gargantuan objects as structures.
## Structures
The structure category contains items that are massive in scale or composed of many smaller objects. For example, a single wall might be an object, but an entire castle would be a structure. Like objects, most structures can be broken. However, due to their scale, they often possess unique rules around breaking.
## Vehicles
The vehicle category includes items that are similar in size to structures and composed of many smaller objects. Vehicles specifically have their own vehicle stat block. Vehicles work differently from other items and are governed by their own rules.
