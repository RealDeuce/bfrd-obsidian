*4th-Circle Primordial (Transmutation)*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a **[[../../Monsters/Animals/Insect, Giant Centipede|giant centipede]]**, a spider becomes a **[[../../Monsters/Animals/Spider, Giant|giant spider]]**, a wasp becomes a **[[../../Monsters/Animals/Insect, Giant Wasp|giant wasp]]**, and a scorpion becomes a **[[../../Monsters/Animals/Insect, Giant Scorpion|giant scorpion]]**.

Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.

A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 HP, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.

The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.
