When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creatureâ€™s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a WIS save. On a failure, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage or 3d8 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a success.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th circle or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot above 3rd.
