*3rd-Circle Divine and Wyrd (Necromancy)*    
**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a WIS save or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:
* Choose one ability. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saves made with that ability.
* While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
* While cursed, the target must make a WIS save at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
* While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

A *[[Remove Curse|remove curse]]* spell ends this effect. At the GMâ€™s discretion, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th circle or higher, the duration becomes concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th circle or higher, the duration is 8 hours (no concentration). If you use a spell slot of 7th circle or higher, the duration is 24 hours (no concentration). If you use a 9th circle spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled (no concentration).
