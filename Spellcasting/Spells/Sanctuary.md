*1st-Circle Divine (Abjuration)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small silver mirror)  
**Duration:** 1 minute

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a WIS save. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesnâ€™t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a *[[Fireball|fireball]]*.

If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.
