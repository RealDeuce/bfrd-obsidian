*6th-Circle Arcane (Evocation)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy within the spell’s range. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three‑quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a DEX save. On a failure, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage or half as much damage on a success.
