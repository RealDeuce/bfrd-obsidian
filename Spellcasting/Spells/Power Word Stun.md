*8th-Circle Arcane, Divine, and Wyrd (Enchantment)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dazed. If the target has 150 HP or fewer, it is [[../../Conditions/Stunned|stunned]]. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. The stunned target must make a CON save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
