*4th-Circle Arcane, Divine, and Wyrd (Enchantment)*

**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (three nut shells)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a WIS save when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a WIS save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th circle or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot above 4th.
