*6th-Circle Arcane (Abjuration)*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self (10-foot radius)
**Components:** V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.

Spell attacks that originate from a creature outside the barrier or any spell of 5th circle or lower cast from outside the barrier canâ€™t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher circle spell slot. Such a spell attack or spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell attack or spell has no effect on them.

Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th circle or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one circle higher for each slot above 6th.
