*8th-Circle Divine and Primordial (Evocation)*    
**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 150 feet (60-foot-radius sphere)  
**Components:** V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a CON save. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is [[../../Conditions/Blinded|blinded]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t blinded by this spell. Undead have disadvantage on this save.

A creature blinded by this spell makes another CON save at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
