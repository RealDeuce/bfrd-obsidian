*1st-Circle Divine and Wyrd (Evocation)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 round

A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a 2ndâ€‘circle spell slot or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot above 1st.
