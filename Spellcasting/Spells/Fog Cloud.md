*1st-Circle Arcane and Primordial (Conjuration)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a 2nd- circle spell slot or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot above 1st.
