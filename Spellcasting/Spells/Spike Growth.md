*2nd-Circle Primordial (Transmutation)*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 150 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven sharpened twigs)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that canâ€™t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a WIS (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
