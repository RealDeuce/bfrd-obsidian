A beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with attacks that use STR until the spell ends.

At the end of each of the targetâ€™s turns, it can make a CON save against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.
