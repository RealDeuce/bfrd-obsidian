*2nd-Circle Arcane (Illusion)*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesnâ€™t rely on sight, as with keensense, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.
