*3rd-Circle Primordial (Conjuration)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot- tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames are doused.

The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DEX save. On a failed save, it falls [[../../Conditions/Prone|prone]].

If a creature is concentrating in the spell’s area, the creature must make a successful CON save against your spell save DC or lose concentration.
