This spell lets you convince an animal that you mean it no harm. Choose a Beast or creature with the Animal tag that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the creature’s INT is 4 (−3) or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the creature must succeed on a WIS save or be [[../../Conditions/Charmed|charmed]] by you for the spell’s duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd circle or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot above 1st.
