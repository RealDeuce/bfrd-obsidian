*2nd-Circle Primordial (Evocation)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale, dim light shines down in a 5-foot‑radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a CON save. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature with the Shapechanger tag makes this save with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its true form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the spell’s light.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd circle or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot above 3rd.
