*1st-Circle Divine and Wyrd (Abjuration)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also canâ€™t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new save against the relevant effect.
