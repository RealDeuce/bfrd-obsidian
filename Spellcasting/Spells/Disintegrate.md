**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and pinch of dust)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by a wall of force spell.

A creature targeted by this spell must make a DEX save. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 HP, it is disintegrated.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a *[[True Resurrection|true resurrection]]* or a *[[Wish|wish]]* spell. If the target is destroyed, any magic items it was wearing or holding drop onto the ground in a space previously occupied by the target.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th circle or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot above 6th.
