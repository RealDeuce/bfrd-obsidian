*4th-Circle Wyrd (Conjuration)*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 90 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a DEX save or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be [[../../Conditions/Restrained|restrained]] by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a STR or DEX check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
