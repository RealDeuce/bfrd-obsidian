*6th-Circle Arcane, Divine, and Wyrd (Necromancy)*    
**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (the powder of a crushed black pearl)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot-radius sphere from a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a CON save. A target takes 8d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th circle or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot above 6th.
