*2nd-Circle Arcane (Evocation)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a leaf of sumac)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You evoke an elemental blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action. When the blade first appears, you decide whether it deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage.

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the elemental blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 damage of the chosen type. The elemental blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th circle or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two slots above 2nd.
