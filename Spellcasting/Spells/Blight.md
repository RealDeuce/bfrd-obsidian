*4th-Circle Divine and Primordial (Necromancy)*    
**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a CON save. It takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on Constructs or Undead.

If you target a Plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the save with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

If you target a nonmagical plant that isnâ€™t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it withers and dies.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th circle or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot above 4th.
