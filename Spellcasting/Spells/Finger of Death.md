*7th-Circle Arcane, Divine, and Wyrd (Necromancy)*    
**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a CON save. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

A Humanoid killed by this spell rises as a **[[../../Monsters/Monsters/Zombie|zombie]]** at the start of your next turn. The zombie is permanently under your command and follows your verbal orders to the best of its ability.
