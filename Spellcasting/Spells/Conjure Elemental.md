*5th-Circle Arcane and Wyrd (Conjuration)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense for air, soft clay for earth, sulfur and phosphorus for fire, or water and sand for water)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon an Elemental servant that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. Choose which Elemental appears: an air elemental, earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental. The GM has the creature’s statistics. If your GM allows it, you can use this spell to summon a different Elemental of your choice of CR 5 or lower. This spell can’t summon creatures with Legendary Actions. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The Elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. In combat, the Elemental acts on your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the Elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th circle or higher, you can choose to summon an Elemental of a CR equal to or below the circle of the expended slot. For example, expending an 8th circle slot allows you to summon an Elemental creature of CR 8 or lower.
