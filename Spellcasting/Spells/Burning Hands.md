**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self (15-foot cone)  
**Components:** V, S

A thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a DEX save. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd circle or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each circle above 1st.
