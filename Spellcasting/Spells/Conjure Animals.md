*3rd-Circle Primordial and Wyrd (Conjuration)*    
**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon Fey spirits that take the form of Beasts and appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:
* One Beast of CR 2 or lower
* Two Beasts of CR 1 or lower
* Four Beasts of CR 1/2 or lower
* Eight Beasts of CR 1/4 or lower

Each Beast is also considered Fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 HP or when the spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. The summoned creatures act on your initiative, taking their turns immediately after yours. They obey any verbal commands you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t give any commands, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. The GM has the creatures’ statistics.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using certain higher-circle spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-circle slot, three times as many with a 7th-circle slot, and four times as many with a 9th-circle slot.
