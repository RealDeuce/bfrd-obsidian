You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a WIS save. On a failed save, the target becomes [[../../Conditions/Frightened|frightened]] of you for the duration. At the end of each of the targetâ€™s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a WIS save or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th circle or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot above 4th.
