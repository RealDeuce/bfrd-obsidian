*3rd-Circle Arcane and Wyrd (Illusion)*    
**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** S, M (a glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial filled with phosphorescent material)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a WIS save. On a failure, the creature becomes [[../../Conditions/Charmed|charmed]] for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is [[../../Conditions/Incapacitated|incapacitated]] and has a speed of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
