*2nd-Circle Divine (Enchantment)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each Humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a CHA save; a creature can choose to fail this save if it wishes. If a creature fails its save, choose one of the following effects.
* **Suppression.** You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
* **Indifference.** Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.
