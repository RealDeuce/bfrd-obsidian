*4th-Circle Wyrd (Evocation)*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 90 feet
**Components:** V
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You can place up to three 20-foot cubes each centered on a point you can see within range. Each object in a cube is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in a cube when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a DEX save. A creature in the area of more than one cube is affected only once. For the duration, each affected object and creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius for the duration.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object canâ€™t benefit from being invisible.
