*1st-Circle Primordial (Transmutation)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of berries)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You transform up to ten berries in your hand, infusing them with magic for up to 24 hours. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 HP and provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day, though a creature canâ€™t be sustained by eating berries two or more days in a row.

The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.
