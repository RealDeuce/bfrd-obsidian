*5th-Circle Divine (Evocation)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a DEX save. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th circle or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each slot above 5th.
