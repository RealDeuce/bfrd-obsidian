*3rd-Circle Arcane (Evocation)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot- radius sphere centered on that point must make a DEX save. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th circle or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot above 3rd.
