*7th-Circle Arcane (Evocation)*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc worth 250 gp)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

When the sword appears, you make two melee spell attacks with the blade, each one against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 + your spellcasting modifier force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 30 feet to an unoccupied spot you can see and repeat these attacks against targets within 5 feet of the blade.
