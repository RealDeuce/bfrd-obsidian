*2nd-Circle Arcane and Primordial (Transmutation)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a manufactured metal object (not a creature), such as a metal weapon or a suit of armor that lacks the Natural Materials property, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes damage from it, the creature must succeed on a CON save or drop the object if it can. If it doesnâ€™t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd circle or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot above 2nd.
