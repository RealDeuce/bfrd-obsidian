*8th-Circle Arcane (Enchantment)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, M (a handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make an INT save.

On a failed save, the creature’s INT and CHA become 1 (−5). The creature can’t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. However, the creature can identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.

At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its save against this spell, ending the spell on a success.

The spell can also be ended by the *[[Greater Restoration|greater restoration]], [[Heal|heal]]*, or *[[Wish|wish]]* spells.
