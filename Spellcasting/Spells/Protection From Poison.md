*2nd-Circle Divine and Primordial (Abjuration)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

For the duration, the target has advantage on saves against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.

***At Higher Circles.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd circle or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot above 2nd.
