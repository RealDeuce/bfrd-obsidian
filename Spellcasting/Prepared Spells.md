A prepared spell is ready to cast quickly, in the heat of battleâ€”all the reading and setup is done beforehand. Due to the intense mental fortitude necessary, the number of spells a caster can prepare at one time is generally limited.

Some spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, must prepare all their spells ahead of time through study or meditation. Different spellcasting classes with shorter known spell lists can automatically prepare all their known spells.

Your character class defines what you must do to prepare spells and how many spells you can have prepared at any given level.
