# Casting Time
Most spells require a single action to cast, but some can be accomplished in a shorter or longer span.
## Bonus Action
A spell cast with a bonus action is fast. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. If you use your bonus action to cast a spell from the 1st circle or higher on your turn, you can’t also use your action to cast a spell from the 1st circle or higher during the same turn.
## Reaction
Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to specific triggering events. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description specifies the trigger condition that must be met before the spell can be cast.
## Longer Casting Times
Certain spells (particularly rituals) require more time to cast, often minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action, bonus action, or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting, and you must maintain concentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but the attempt doesn’t expend a spell slot or material components unless the spell states otherwise. To try casting the spell again, you must start over.
# Range
The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like *magic missile*, the target is a creature. For a spell like *fireball*, the target is a point in space where the ball of fire erupts.

Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the *shield* spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that appear in cones or lines that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point must be you.

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range unless the spell’s description says otherwise.
# Area of Effect
Spells such as *burning hands* and *cone of cold* cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Usually, it is a point in space that you choose within the spell’s range, though some spells originate from a creature or an object.

A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from its point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these straight lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.
## Cone
A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin (typically the spellcaster). A cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone’s point of origin isn’t included in the cone’s area of effect unless you decide otherwise.
## Cube
You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on one face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.

A cube’s point of origin isn’t included in the cube’s area of effect unless you decide otherwise.
## Cylinder
A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle with the point of origin must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.
## Line
A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line’s point of origin isn’t included in the line’s area of effect unless you decide otherwise.
## Sphere
You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.
# Components
A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must provide to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you can’t cast the spell.
## Verbal (V)
Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged, affected by the deafened condition, or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.
## Somatic (S)
Spellcasting might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of motions. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures. Note this means spells with somatic components typically can’t be cast while holding a weapon in one hand and a shield in the other.
## Material (M)
Casting some spells requires specific objects detailed in parentheses in the component entry. A character can typically use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus in place of material components specified for a spell. However, if a specific cost is indicated for a material component, a pouch or focus can’t substitute for it. The character must have that specific component to cast the spell. If a spell specifies a cost for a material component, the component provided must be worth at least the listed amount, but a suitable component worth more than the specified amount can be used.

If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.

A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—but it can be the same hand that they use to perform somatic components.
# Duration
## Instantaneous
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant. Some spells list an instantaneous duration but create long- lasting effects described in detail in the spell description.
## Concentration
Some spells require concentration to keep the magic active. If you lose concentration on a spell that requires it, the spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, it will say so in its duration entry, and it specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:
* Casting another spell that requires concentration. You immediately lose concentration on the first spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.
* Taking damage. When you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a CON save to maintain your concentration. The DC of this save equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, make a separate save for each source of damage.
* Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.

The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a CON save to maintain concentration on a spell.
# Description
## Target
A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect.

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed unless a spell says otherwise.
### A Clear Path to the Target
To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and the point, the point of origin appears on the side of that obstruction nearest to you.
### Targeting Yourself
If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the spell says otherwise. For example, some spells specify that the target must be hostile to you or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.
# Spell Saves
Many spells specify that a target can make a save to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability the target uses for the save, such as DEX or WIS, and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist a spell equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your PB + any special modifiers. Your spellcasting class typically dictates which spellcasting ability modifier you use.
## Spell Attack Rolls
Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus for a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your PB. Your spellcasting class typically dictates which spellcasting ability modifier you use.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and isn’t incapacitated.
