You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future.

In addition, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.

This spell immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.

Once you target a creature with this spell, the same creature can’t gain the benefits of this spell until 7 days have passed.
