*3rd-Circle Wyrd Ritual (Illusion)*
**Casting Time:** 1 minute
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (an apple made of gold worth 5 gp)
**Duration:** 1 hour

A Large, quasi-real, horse-like creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creatureâ€™s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is ever more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a **[[Horse, Riding|riding horse]]**, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it, if the steed takes any damage, or if you use this spell to summon a different steed.
