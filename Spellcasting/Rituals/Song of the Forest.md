*4th-Circle Primordial Ritual (Transmutation)*  
**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a dried leaf, crumpled and released)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You attune your senses to the natural world so that you can detect every sound that occurs within 60 feet of you. You can clearly picture the source of each sound in your mind. While the spell is active, you have tremorsense to a range of 10 feet, darkvision to a range of 30 feet, and you have advantage on WIS (Perception) checks.

Once you cast this spell, you canâ€™t do so again until you complete a long rest.
