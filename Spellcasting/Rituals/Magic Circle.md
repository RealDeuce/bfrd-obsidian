*3rd-Circle Arcane, Divine, and Wyrd Ritual (Abjuration)*    
**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:
* The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a CHA save.
* The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
* Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.

When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

***At Higher Circles.*** As you unlock higher circles, this ritual grows in potency. Once you have access to 4th-circle spell slots, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot you have access to above 3rd.
