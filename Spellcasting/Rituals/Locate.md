*2nd-Circle Arcane, Divine, Primordial, and Wyrd Ritual (Divination)*    
**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** Self (1 mile)  
**Components:** V, S, M (a figurine of a bloodhound worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Describe or name a particular kind of object (such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, tool, or weapon) or particular kind of creature (such as a human or a unicorn). If a suitable target is within range of the spell, you sense the direction to the nearest creature or object within the spell’s range. If the target is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

This spell can’t locate a creature or object if it in is a different form, such as being under the effects of a *[[../Spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]* spell, or if the target is shielded by an effect that blocks divination magic, like the *[[../Spells/Nondetection|nondetection]]* spell.

You can only have a single casting of *locate* active on yourself at one time. If you cast this spell a second time, the first casting immediately ends.

***At Higher Circles.*** As you unlock higher circles, this ritual grows in potency. Once you have access to 4th-circle spell slots, you can use this spell to locate a specific creature or object that is familiar to you. In addition, the duration of this spell increases to concentration, up to 1 hour.
