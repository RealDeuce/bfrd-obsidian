*5th-Circle Arcane, Divine, and Wyrd Ritual (Enchantment)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, M (a set of silver manacles worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** 30 days

You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a WIS save or become [[../../Conditions/Charmed|charmed]] by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that canâ€™t understand you is unaffected by the spell.

You can issue any command you choose. However, should you issue a command that would result in certain death, the spell ends.

You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A *[[../Spells/Remove Curse|remove curse]], [[../Spells/Greater Restoration|greater restoration]]*, or *[[../Spells/Wish|wish]]* spell also ends it.

At Higher Circles. As you unlock higher circles, this ritual grows in potency. Once you have access to 7th-circle spell slots, the duration of this spell is 1 year. Once you have access to 9th-circle spell slots, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.
