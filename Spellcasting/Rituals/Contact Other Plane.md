*5th-Circle Arcane and Wyrd Ritual (Divination)*  
**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, M (incense or a sacrificial offering appropriate for the entity contacted worth 25 gp, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** 1 minute

You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar being can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 INT save. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and become [[../../Conditions/Incapacitated|incapacitated]] until you finish a long rest. While incapacitated in this way, you can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish. A *[[../Spells/Greater Restoration|greater restoration]]* spell cast on you ends this effect.

On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting that you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret. If you receive no answer, you can’t attempt to cast this spell again until 24 hours have passed.
