*9th-Circle Primordial Ritual (Transmutation)*
**Casting Time:** 10 minutes
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S, M (raw silk worth 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a willing creature and transform it in one of the following four ways (the target must agree with the option you choose):
* If the creature is Humanoid, you can change its lineage to any other lineage you choose. It loses any traits and abilities associated with its former lineage and gains any traits and abilities of the new lineage.
* You can lower one of its ability scores by 2 (modifier decreases by âˆ’1) and increase a different ability score by 2 (modifier increases by +1), to a maximum of 20.
* You give the creature birdlike or batlike wings. It gains a flying speed of 30 feet. Alternatively, you can remove its wings, which takes away an existing flying speed.

You might be able to achieve a different effect of a similar kind with the permission of your GM.

A creature can be affected by this spell only once a year. If the spell is cast on it again before a year has passed, the casting fails.
