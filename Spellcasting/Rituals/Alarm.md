*1st-Circle Arcane Ritual (Abjuration)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (silver hand bell worth at least 10 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you when a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that wonâ€™t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

If you perform this ritual a second time before the duration of the first *alarm* spell has ended, the first alarm immediately ends.
