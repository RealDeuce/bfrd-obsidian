*7th-Circle Divine and Primordial Ritual (Transmutation)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a prayer wheel or an intact sleeve of snakeskin and holy water)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 HP at the start of each of its turns (10 HP each minute).

The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.

Once you cast this spell, you can’t do so again until you complete a long rest.
