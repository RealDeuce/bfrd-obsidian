Ritual spells are uniquely powerful magic that take 1 minute or longer to cast and often require costly material components. A caster can only learn ritual spells associated with their source spell list. Your character class defines whether you can access ritual spells and how many rituals you know at each class level.

Ritual spells don’t use spell slots and therefore can’t be cast at higher circles in the way standard spells can. However, certain ritual spells automatically increase in power as a caster gains access to higher circle spell slots. This represents how casters channel greater amounts of magic as they advance in level. For example, a 3rd-level cleric can cast the base version of the 2nd-circle ritual spell *prayer of healing* to heal up to 2d8 + WIS modifier hit points. When that same cleric gets access to 3rd-circle spell slots at 5th level, their *prayer of healing* spell automatically becomes more powerful, allowing them to heal up to 3d8 + WIS modifier hit points.

For the purposes of setting DCs for effects like *dispel magic*, ritual spells that scale are always assumed to be cast at the highest circle the caster has access to or the spell’s listed circle, whichever is higher.

Otherwise, ritual spells follow normal spellcasting rules.
