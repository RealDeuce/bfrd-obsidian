Every spell has a circle, ranked from 1st to 9th. The higher a spell’s circle, the more energy it requires to cast and the stronger its effect.

Like the rings within a tree trunk, circles of magic encircle one another. A novice spellcaster starts at the center of the circle with access only to the 1st circle. As a spellcaster grows in ability, their power expands outward, giving them access to higher circles. The further a circle is from the center, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that circle’s spells.

Each class provides a table of what spellcaster level you must achieve before you gain access to new spell circles. Typically, a spellcaster must be at least 17th level before they can cast spells from the 9th—and final—circle.

# Cantrips
Some spellcasters can cast a simple type of spell called a cantrip. A caster can cast a cantrip without using a spell slot and without preparing it. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the energy needed to produce the effect on demand. A cantrip’s spell circle is 0.

Your character class defines whether you can access cantrips and how many cantrips you know at each class level. Many cantrips increase in power as you do. Regardless of how you have the cantrip (such as from a class or a talent), you use your character level, not your level in a spellcasting class, to determine the cantrip’s power.
