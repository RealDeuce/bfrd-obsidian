# Choose a Class
Your character class gives you class features—cool things your character can do—at 1st level as described in its features table. The class features table lists features you gain access to as your character levels up.

Your character class also gives you **proficiencies**, a game term that describes what kinds of equipment you are trained to use (such as armor, weapons, and tools) and what kinds of challenges you are best at handling (skills and saves).
# Determine Ability Scores
At their core, characters are defined by six abilities:
* Strength (STR), representing your physical might.
* Dexterity (DEX), representing your agility and reaction time.
* Constitution (CON), representing your endurance and physical fortitude.
* Intelligence (INT), representing your ability to acquire and apply knowledge.
* Wisdom (WIS), representing your intuition and mental fortitude.
* Charisma (CHA), representing your self-confidence and your ability to influence others.

Each ability is assigned a number, called an **ability score**. Ability scores represent your various physical and mental abilities. Higher numbers in a score mean your character is better with that ability.

As you level up, you can increase these scores, but a PC can never have an ability score higher than 20. An average person has 10 in every ability score, so these numbers emphasize how powerful adventurers are!
## Three Ways to Score
### Method 1: Rolling
* Roll four d6s. Find the lowest die, and throw it out. Then add up the remaining three dice to get your total. Write that number down on scratch paper.
* Do this five more times until you have six totals between 3 and 18.
* Assign those six numbers to the ability scores however you like.
* Finally, add 2 to one score of your choice that is 16 or below and add 1 to one score of your choice that is 17 or below.
### Method 2: Point-Buy
* Start with 32 points to spend on your ability scores.
* Each score costs a certain number of points. Find the cost of each potential score on the **Point-Buy Cost** table (For example, a score of 12 costs 4 points).
* 18 is the highest ability score you can start with, and you can’t have a score lower than 8.
* Buy one score for each of the six abilities.
* Don’t add anything extra when you’re done here. These numbers are already balanced without adding more.
###### Point-Buy Cost
| Score | Cost |
| ----- | ---- |
| 8     | 0    |
| 9     | 1    |
| 10    | 2    |
| 11    | 3    |
| 12    | 4    |
| 13    | 5    |
| 14    | 7    |
| 15    | 9    |
| 16    | 11   |
| 17    | 13   |
| 18    | 16   |
### Method 3: Standard Array
To just get going, use the standard array. Start with six numbers: 16, 14, 14, 13, 10, and 8. Assign them as ability scores however you want. Again, don’t modify them any further. That’s it!
## Find Ability Modifiers
Once you assign scores, use the following charts to figure out your **ability modifiers**. Ability modifiers are the most important part of your ability scores. As the name suggests, these modify your dice when you roll for things. You use modifiers much more than your score to calculate success or failure in the game.
###### Ability Modifiers
| Ability Score | Modifier |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 1 | −5 |
| 2–3 | −4 |
| 4–5 | −3 |
| 6–7 | −2 |
| 8–9 | −1 |
| 10–11 | +0 |
| 12–13 | +1 |
| 14–15 | +2 |
| 16–17 | +3 |
| 18–19 | +4 |
| 20 | +5 |
# Choose a Lineage
Choose your character’s lineage from the options in the **[[../Lineage and Heritage/Lineages|Lineage]]** section.
# Choose a Heritage
Choose your character’s heritage from the options in the **[[../Lineage and Heritage/Heritages|Heritage]]** section.
# Choose a Background
Choose your character’s background from the options presented in the **[[../Backgrounds and Talents/Backgrounds|Backgrounds]]** section.
# Starting Equipment
There are two methods for determining what equipment your character starts with.
## Method 1: Take Class & Background Equipment
The simple way to get starting equipment is to take all the starting equipment listed in your base class description combined with the additional equipment listed in your background. Write the equipment from those two sources on your character sheet, and you’re ready to play!
## Method 2: Determine Starting Wealth & Buy Equipment
The more involved method for determining starting equipment is to calculate your starting gold pieces (gp) by rolling 5d4 x 10 gp, and then purchase equipment using the equipment charts. Spend as much of your starting money as you want, then note any unspent gp on your character sheet along with your new equipment.
