This contains the bits of Black Flag Roleplaying Reference Document I want in Obsidian.

The monsters use the Fantasy Statblocks Obsidian plugin. You will need to import the Basic ToV Layout. Got to Settings -> Community Plugins -> Fantasy Statblocks -> Layouts and press the Import from JSON button. Browse to where this file is, and select `Basic ToV Layout.json` you may need to restart Obsidian for the layout to take effect.

Got to Settings -> Community Plugins -> Fantasy Statblocks -> Layouts and press the Import from JSON button. Browse to where this file is, and select `Basic ToV Vehicle Layout.json` you may need to restart Obsidian for the layout to take effect.
