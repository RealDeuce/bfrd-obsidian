Presented here are rules for incorporating gunpowder and firearms into your game.

***Loading a Firearm.*** Early firearms use a paper “cartridge,” a paper cylinder packed with an iron or lead ball, gunpowder, and a primer. To load a firearm, the wielder opens the paper cartridge, pours the gunpowder into the end of the barrel, followed by the ball and the paper. A rod is used to ram the ball and paper down the barrel. Hit or miss, ammunition from a firearm is destroyed once expended.

***Obvious Weapons.*** When a character makes a ranged attack with a firearm, the firearm releases a thunderous boom audible out to the weapon’s maximum range. In addition, firearms release a small puff of smoke when fired.

***Proficiency.*** A “firearm” is any ranged weapon with the Gunpowder weapon property. Firearms are designated as simple or martial ranged weapons similar to crossbows and other ranged weapons. A PC with simple or martial weapon proficiency also has proficiency with simple or martial firearms, respectively.
# Optional Gunpowder Rules
Here are some optional gunpowder rules:

***Misfire.*** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll with a weapon with the Gunpowder property, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and you can’t use the weapon again until you spend an action to repair it. Repairing a firearm requires a successful DC 10 INT check using tinker tools. If the check fails, the weapon is jammed and can’t be used again until the jam is cleared. Clearing a jammed weapon takes 10 minutes of work, using tinker tools.

***Special Training.*** A character can spend downtime pursuing the Training downtime activity to gain proficiency with martial firearms. Alternatively, training might result in the character becoming proficient with one or more specific firearms.

***Wet Ammunition.*** A character with a firearm would need to keep paper cartridges in a waterproof container or risk losing the ammunition each time the PC is in the rain or goes for a swim.
# Firearms
The **Firearm Weapons** table lists the cost, damage dice and type, weight, weapon options, and special properties for firearm weapons. The table is also split by the proficiencies required (simple or martial) to wield the various firearms most effectively.

## Weapon Options
This section offers an additional weapon option compatible with certain firearms.
## Harmless Fusillade
When you make an attack with this weapon, you can harmlessly discharge the weapon instead of dealing damage while aiming at a creature within the weapon’s normal range. On a successful hit, the target must succeed on a CON save or have disadvantage on the next concentration check it makes before the start of your next turn.
## Weapon Properties
The following section includes a new weapon property unique to the firearm weapons described in this book.

***Gunpowder.*** If you roll the highest possible number on an individual damage die (such as a 6 on a d6 or a 12 on a d12) when you attack with this weapon, you can roll that die again and add the result to the total. For example, if your 2d4 roll resulted in a 3 and 4, you can reroll the 4, adding the result to the current total of 7. When a damage die results in the highest possible number on the die, it is called a “burst.”

If you roll the highest possible number again, you can roll the damage die again and add the result to the total, further increasing the weapon’s damage. Any of the damage dice for this weapon, including extra dice such as from a critical hit or sneak attack, can burst and result in a reroll. For each attack you make with this weapon, you can reroll only a number of burst dice equal to your proficiency bonus, regardless of how many damage dice result in the highest possible number.

If a single attack with a weapon or item with this property hits multiple targets, the damage is treated as one attack or effect for the purposes of determining how many times the damage can experience a burst, regardless of how many targets take the damage.

***Magazine.*** Weapons with this property can be loaded with multiple pieces of ammunition, allowing a character to fire the weapon without having to reload between shots—as long as at least one piece of unspent ammunition is in the magazine. Weapons with this property have a number listed next to this property specifying the maximum pieces of ammunition the magazine can hold. For example, a property listed as “Magazine (8)” indicates that weapon’s magazine can hold up to eight pieces of ammunition at one time.
## Special Weapons
Various firearms are detailed here.
***Arquebus.*** This very heavy barreled firearm fires solid metal balls and deals devastating damage at short range.

***Blunderbuss.*** This firearm features a flared muzzle. When you fire the weapon, it releases bullets in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 DEX save, taking 2d4 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each time you use the blunderbuss, it expends 5 pieces of ammunition, and, as with all firearms, the ammunition can’t be recovered at the end of battle. Firing a blunderbuss releases a thunderous boom that is audible out to 200 feet.

***Musket.*** This long-barreled firearm comes in different styles. Its wooden handle often features engravings and other decorative embellishments that have significance to the owner or the original craftsperson.

***Pistol.*** This small firearm fits easily in one hand, and its wooden handle often features unique engravings, similar to those found on muskets.

***Revolving Musket.*** This long-barreled firearm holds a removable, metal, cylindrical magazine, which allows the firearm to be fired multiple times before needing to be reloaded. The attached magazine must have at least one paper cartridge loaded into it to make a ranged attack with this weapon.
## Special Gear
Items that support or involve gunpowder or firearms are detailed here.

| Magazine              | 1 gp   | 1 lb.   |
| Paper Cartridges (10) | 2 gp   | 1 lb.   |

***Bandolier.*** This leather, cross-body shoulder belt contains loops and several small pockets. It can hold up to 20 paper cartridges and up to three pistols.

***Cartridge Pouch.*** This leather belt pouch can hold 30 paper cartridges. The pouch is painted with a retardant material and is resistant to fire damage.

***Gunpowder.*** Gunpowder is a black, granular, alchemical mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, giving the substance its more common name of “black powder.” It is a necessary ingredient in the paper cartridges used by firearms. Igniting an ounce of gunpowder causes it to burn for 1 round, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Gunpowder in larger quantities can have more devastating effects. When used as a weapon or explosive device, gunpowder has the Gunpowder weapon property:
* **Barrel.** A barrel contains enough gunpowder to fill approximately 40 gunpowder horns. Igniting a full barrel of gunpowder causes it to explode at the end of the next round. Each creature within 15 feet of the barrel must make a DC 12 DEX save, taking 5 (2d4) piercing damage and 17 (5d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
* **Horn.** A horn contains enough gunpowder to create 30 paper cartridges. Igniting a full horn of gunpowder causes it to explode immediately. Each creature within 5 feet of the horn must make a DC 12 DEX save, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
* **Keg.** A keg contains enough gunpowder to fill approximately 20 gunpowder horns. Igniting a full keg of gunpowder causes it to explode at the end of the next round. Each creature within 10 feet of the keg must make a DC 12 DEX save, taking 2 (1d4) piercing damage and 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Magazine.*** This empty magazine can hold an amount of ammunition for a firearm with the Magazine property up to the value noted in parenthesis on that property.

***Paper Cartridge.*** This small tube of beeswax-coated paper contains gunpowder and a metal bullet, and it is the primary ammunition for weapons with the Gunpowder property.
