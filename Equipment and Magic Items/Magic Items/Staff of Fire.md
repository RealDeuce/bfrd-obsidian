*Staff, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)*  
*63,500 gp*

You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Burning Hands|burning hands]]* (1 charge), *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Fireball|fireball]]* (3 charges), or *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Wall of Fire|wall of fire]]* (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
