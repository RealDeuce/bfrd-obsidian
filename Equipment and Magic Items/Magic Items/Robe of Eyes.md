*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*  
*8,000 gp*

This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:
* You can see in all directions, and you have advantage on WIS (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
* You have darkvision to a range of 120 feet.
* You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see into the Ethereal Plane, to a range of 120 feet.

The eyes on the robe canâ€™t be closed or averted. Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.

A *light* spell cast on the robe or a *daylight* spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be [[Blinded|blinded]] for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a CON save (DC 11 for light or DC 15 for daylight), ending the blindness on a success.
