You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Cone of Cold|cone of cold]]* (5 charges), *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Fog Cloud|fog cloud]]* (1 charge), *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Ice Storm|ice storm]]* (4 charges), or *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Wall of Ice|wall of ice]]* (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and is destroyed.
