*Ring, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*  
*100,000 gp*

While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saves against any spell that targets only you. In addition, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th circle or lower, the spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the spell slot, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.
