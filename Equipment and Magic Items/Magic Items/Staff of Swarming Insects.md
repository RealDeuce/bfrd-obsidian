*Staff, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)*  
*15,300 gp*

This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a swarm of insects consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses. The staff has the following additional properties:

***Spells.*** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Giant Insect|giant insect]]* (4 charges) or *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Insect Plague|insect plague]]* (5 charges).

***Insect Cloud.*** While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30‑foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect.
