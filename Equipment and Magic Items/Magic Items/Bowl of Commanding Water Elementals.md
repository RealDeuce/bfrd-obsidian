*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
*14,500 gp*

This bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons. While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl’s command word and summon a **[[../../Monsters/Monsters/Water Elemental|water elemental]]**, as if you had cast the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Conjure Elemental|conjure elemental]]* spell. The bowl can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
