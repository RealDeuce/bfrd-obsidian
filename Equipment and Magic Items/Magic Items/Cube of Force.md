*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*  
*17,600 gp*

This cube is about 1 inch across. Each face has a distinct marking that can be pressed. The *cube* starts with 36 charges.

You can use an action to press one of the *cube’s* faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the **Cube of Force Faces** table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens.

Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the *cube’s* sixth face, or the *cube* runs out of charges.

You can change the barrier’s effect by pressing a different cube face and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration. When you press a different face, the current face effect ends.

If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can’t pass through the cube, you can’t move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.
