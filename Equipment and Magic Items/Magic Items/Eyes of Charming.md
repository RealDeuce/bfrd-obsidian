*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*  
*1,500 gp*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges and regain all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Charm|charm]]* spell (save DC 13) on a Humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other.
