Many types of Ioun stones exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.

When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 DEX (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has AC 24, 10 HP, and resistance to all damage. It is considered an object that is also a carried item while it orbits your head.

***Absorption (Very Rare, 32,000 gp).*** While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th circle or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

Once the stone has canceled 20 circles worth of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose circle is higher than the number of spell rings the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.

***Agility (Very Rare, 30,000 gp).*** Your DEX score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.

***Awareness (Rare, 4,000 gp).*** You can’t be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.

***Fortitude (Very Rare, 30,000 gp).*** Your CON score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.

***Greater Absorption (Legendary, 75,000 gp).*** While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th circle or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

Once the stone has canceled 50 circles worth of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose circle is higher than the number of spell rings the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.

***Insight (Very Rare, 30,000 gp).*** Your WIS score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.

**Intellect (Very Rare, 30,000 gp).** Your INT score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.

***Leadership (Very Rare, 30,000 gp).*** Your CHA score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.

***Mastery (Legendary, 50,000 gp).*** Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.

***Protection (Rare, 8,000 gp).*** You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.

***Regeneration (Legendary, 50,000 gp).*** You regain 15 HP at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 HP.

***Reserve (Rare, 6,000 gp).*** This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 circles worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 − 1 circles of stored spells chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd circle into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The circle of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the spell slot, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. Once cast, the spell is expended, freeing up space.

***Strength (Very Rare, 30,000 gp).*** Your STR score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.

***Sustenance (Rare, 4,000 gp).*** You don’t need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.
