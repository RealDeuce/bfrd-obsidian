*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
*14,500 gp*

This 6-inch-wide, 1-foot-high vessel resembles a chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound. While incense is burning in this censer, you can use an action to speak the censer’s command word and summon an **[[../../Monsters/Monsters/Air Elemental|air elemental]]**, as if you had cast the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Conjure Elemental|conjure elemental]]* spell. The censer can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
