*Potion, Rarity Varies*  
*Price Varies*

When you drink this potion, your STR score changes for 1 hour. The type of Giant determines the score, as shown on the **Potion of Giant Strength Type** table. The potion has no effect if your STR score equals or exceeds that score.

This potionâ€™s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The potion of frost giant strength and the potion of stone giant strength have the same effect.
