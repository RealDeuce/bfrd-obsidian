*Weapon (Any Sword), Rare (Requires Attunement)*  
*8,000 gp*

Hit points lost to this weapon’s damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can choose (no action required) to wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature’s turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you’ve wounded it. It can then make a DC 15 CON save, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 WIS (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.
