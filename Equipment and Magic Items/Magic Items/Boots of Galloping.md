*Wondrous Item, Common*  
*25 gp*

These white and brown suede boots are patterned like a horseâ€™s coat. While wearing the boots, you can use a bonus action to make your footfalls sound like those of a galloping horse. The sound is audible to 300 feet. A creature who uses their action to make a DC 10 INT (Investigation) check can determine the sound is unreal.
