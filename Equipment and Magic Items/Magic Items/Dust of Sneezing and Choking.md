*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*  
*100 gp*

Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be *[[Dust of Disappearance|dust of disappearance]]*, and an *identify* spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is [[Incapacitated|incapacitated]] and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The *restoration* spell can also end the effect on a creature.
