*Weapon (Any Sword), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*  
*200,000 gp*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with it, the target takes an extra 2d10 radiant damage.

While you wield this sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.
