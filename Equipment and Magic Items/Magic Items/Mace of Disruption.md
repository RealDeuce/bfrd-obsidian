*Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)*  
*8,000 gp*

When you hit a Fiend or Undead with this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 HP or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 WIS save or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
