*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
*14,500 gp*

This brass brazier weighs 5 pounds. While a fire burns in it, you can use an action to speak the brazier’s command word and summon a **[[../../Monsters/Monsters/Fire Elemental|fire elemental]]**, as if you had cast the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Conjure Elemental|conjure elemental]]* spell. The brazier can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
