*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)*  
*Price Varies*

The typical crystal ball is a very rare magic item about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, as an action, you can cast the *[[Scrying|scrying]]* spell (save DC 17) from it.

The following crystal ball variants are legendary items and have additional properties.

***Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.*** While scrying with the crystal ball, you can use an action to cast the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]* spell (save DC 17) from it, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s scrying sensor. You don’t need to concentrate to maintain detect thoughts for the duration of the spell, but it ends if the *scrying* spell ends.

***Crystal Ball of Telepathy.*** While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s scrying sensor (no action required). You can also use an action to cast the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Suggestion|suggestion]]* spell (save DC 17) from it through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don’t need to concentrate to maintain suggestion for the duration of the spell, but it ends if the *scrying* spell ends. The *suggestion* spell of the crystal ball can’t be used again until the next dawn.

***Crystal Ball of True Seeing.*** While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell’s scrying sensor.
