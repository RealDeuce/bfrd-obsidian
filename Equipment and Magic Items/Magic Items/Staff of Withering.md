*Staff, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Cleric, Druid, or Warlock)*  
*8,800 gp*

This staff has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge as part of your Attack action to deal an extra 2d10 necrotic damage to the target. In addition, the target must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or have disadvantage for 1 hour on any ability check or save that uses STR or CON.
