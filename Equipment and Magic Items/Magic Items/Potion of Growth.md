*Potion, Uncommon*  
*200 gp*

When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Enlarge or Reduce|enlarge/reduce]]* spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
