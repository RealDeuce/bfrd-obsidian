*Weapon (Any Sword), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*  
*8,800 gp*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 HP, it must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a Construct or an Undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.
