*Staff, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard, Cleric, or Druid)*  
*22,500 gp*

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Cure Wounds|cure wounds]]* (1 charge per spell circle, up to 4th), *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Restoration|restoration]]* (2 charges), or *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Mass Cure Wounds|mass cure wounds]]* (5 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.
