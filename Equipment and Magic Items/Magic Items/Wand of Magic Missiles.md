*Wand, Uncommon*  
*2,500 gp*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Magic Missile|magic missile]]* spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-circle version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot circle by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wandâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
