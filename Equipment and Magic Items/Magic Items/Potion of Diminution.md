*Potion, Rare*  
*200 gp*

When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Enlarge or Reduce|enlarge/reduce]]* spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it.
