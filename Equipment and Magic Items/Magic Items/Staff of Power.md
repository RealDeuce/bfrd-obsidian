*Staff, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)*  
*125,000 gp*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, saves, and spell attack rolls.

The staff has 20 charges and regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges. The staff has the following additional properties:

***Power Strike.*** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge as part of your Attack action to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.

***Spells.*** While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Cone of Cold|cone of cold]]* (5 charges), *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Fireball|fireball]]* (5th-circle version, 5 charges), *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Globe of Invulnerability|globe of invulnerability]]* (6 charges), *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Greater Hold|greater hold]]* (5 charges), *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Levitate|levitate]]* (2 charges), *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Lightning Bolt|lightning bolt]]* (5th- circle version, 5 charges), *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Magic Missile|magic missile]]* (1 charge), *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Ray of Enfeeblement|ray of enfeeblement]]* (1 charge), or *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Wall of Force|wall of force]]* (5 charges).

***Retributive Strike.*** You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff.

Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 DEX save. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
###### Retributive Strike Damage
| Distance from Origin | Damage |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| 10 ft. away or closer | 8 × the number of charges in the staff |
| 11 to 20 ft. away | 6 × the number of charges in the staff |
| 21 to 30 ft. away | 4 × the number of charges in the staff |
