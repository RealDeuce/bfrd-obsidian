*Weapon (Arrow), Very Rare*  
*650 gp*

An *arrow of slaying* is a piece of magic ammunition effective against a particular kind of creature. If a creature belonging to the type associated with an *arrow of slaying* takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 CON save, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an *arrow of slaying* deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.

Ammunition of this type exists for other weapons, such as *bolts of slaying* meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.
