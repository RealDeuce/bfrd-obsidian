*Wondrous Item (Any Piercing Ammunition), Common*  
*10 gp*

These arrowheads are made from hollowed antler and emit a shrill whistle while airborne. A successful attack made with a howling arrow deals only half damage, but the target must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or be deafened until the end of its next turn.
