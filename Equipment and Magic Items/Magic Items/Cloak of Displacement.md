*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*  
*60,000 gp*

While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the illusion ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This effect is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.
