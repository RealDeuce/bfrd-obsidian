*Potion, Uncommon*  
*50 gp*

When you drink this potion, animals tend to be friendly to you for 1 hour. For the duration, you can use an action to cast the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Animal Friendship|animal friendship]]* spell (save DC 13) at any time. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.
