*Armor (Scale Mail), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*  
*60,000 gp*

Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them. Other times, hunters skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saves against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type. The damage type depends on the dragon scales used to make the armor, as shown on the **Dragon Scale Mail Type** table.

In addition, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.
