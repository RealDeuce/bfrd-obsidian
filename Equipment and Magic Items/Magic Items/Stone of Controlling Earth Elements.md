*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
*14,500 gp*

This carved stone weighs 5 pounds. If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an **[[../../Monsters/Monsters/Earth Elemental|earth elemental]]**, as if you had cast the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Conjure Elemental|conjure elemental]]* spell. The stone canâ€™t be used this way again until the next dawn.
