*Wand, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*  
*10,000 gp*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Lightning Bolt|lightning bolt]]* spell (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-circle version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot circle by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
