*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*  
*3,000 gp*

While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Scorching Ray|scorching ray]]* spell with it. When you make the spell’s attacks, you do so with an attack bonus of +5. The circlet can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
