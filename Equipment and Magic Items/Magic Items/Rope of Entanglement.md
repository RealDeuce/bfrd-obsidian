*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
*8,000 gp*

This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or become restrained.

You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 STR or DEX check (targetâ€™s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 HP. It regains 1 HP every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 HP. If the rope drops to 0 HP, it is destroyed.
