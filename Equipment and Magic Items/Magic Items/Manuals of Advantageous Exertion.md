These handwritten books contain exercises and insights into improving your ability scores. Their words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying a bookâ€™s contents and practicing its guidelines, one of your ability scores increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The ability that increases is shown on the **Manuals of Advantageous Exertion Type** table. Afterward, the manual loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
