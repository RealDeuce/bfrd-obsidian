*Ring, Very Rare (Requires Attunement Outdoors at Night)*  
*33,000 gp*

While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, as an action you can cast *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Dancing Lights|dancing lights]]* and *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Light|light]]* from it.

For its other properties, the ring has 6 charges.

***Faerie Fire.*** You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast faerie fire from the ring.

***Ball Lightning.*** You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less power each sphere has.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 DEX save. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.
###### Ball Lightning Damage
| Spheres | Lightning Damage |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| 4 | 2d4 |
| 3 | 2d6 |
| 2 | 5d4 |
| 1 | 4d12 |

***Shooting Stars.*** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 DEX save, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.
