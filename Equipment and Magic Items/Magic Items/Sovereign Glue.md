*Wondrous Item, Legendary*  
*25,000 gp*

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with *[[Oil of Slipperiness|oil of slipperiness]]*. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of *universal solvent* or *oil of etherealness*, or with a *wish* spell.
