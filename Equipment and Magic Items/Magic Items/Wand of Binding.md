*Wand, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*  
*10,900 gp*

This wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wandâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed. The wand has the following additional properties:

***Spells.*** While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Greater Hold|greater hold]]* (5 charges) or *[[../../Spellcasting/Spells/Hold|hold]]* (2 charges).

***Assisted Escape.*** While holding the wand, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain advantage on a save you make to avoid being paralyzed or restrained, or you can expend 1 charge and gain advantage on any check you make to escape a grapple.
