*Wondrous Item, Common*  
*50 gp*

This pair of light silver anklets look like a running cat chasing a swallow in flight. When you roll initiative while wearing the anklets, you can add your PB to your initiative. You can’t use this property if you are surprised.

Once this feature is used, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
