# Mount Gear and Expenses
***Barding.*** Barding is armor designed to protect a mount’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the **Armor** table can be purchased as barding. The cost of barding is four times the equivalent armor made for Humanoids and weighs twice as much.

***Drawn Objects.*** A mount pulling a drawn object like a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the drawn object. If multiple animals pull the same object, they can add their carrying capacity together.

***Saddle.*** A saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat in battle. It gives you advantage on any ability check or save you make to remain mounted. At the GM’s discretion, a saddle crafted for an unusually sized or shaped mount might double or triple the cost.
