Keelboats are small sailing vessels that operate with
minimal crew. Keelboats are good for day trips or
transporting small amounts of cargo or passengers.
The keelboat stat block included here is outfitted with a
ballista, but less expensive keelboats without weaponry are
commonly available for purchase.
