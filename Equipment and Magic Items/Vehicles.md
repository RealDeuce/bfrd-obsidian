***Vehicle Proficiency.*** Vehicle proficiency works just like tool proficiency. When you have proficiency in a vehicle, choose one type: land or water. You must have multiple proficiencies to have proficiency with more than one type of vehicle.

Vehicle proficiency allows you to add your PB to any check you make to control all vehicles of that type in difficult circumstances. You can also repair damaged vehicles of that type.
# Elements of a Vehicle
Each vehicle has the following characteristics.
## Size
Every vehicle has a listed size just like creatures do.
## Type
A vehicle is made to traverse a particular terrain. This is represented by a vehicle’s type, which can include one or more of the following options.

**Land.** A land vehicle can travel on solid surfaces and across physical terrain. Such vehicles include war wagons and sand skimmers. If a land vehicle can traverse horizontal and upside-down surfaces, it has a climbing speed. If it can travel underground, it has a burrowing speed.

**Water.** A water vehicle can travel on or below water or other liquid surfaces. These include ships and submersibles. If a water vehicle can travel while submerged, it has a swimming speed.
## Armor Class & Damage Threshold
Each vehicle has an armor class (AC) which determines how difficult it is to hit. In addition, vehicles have a damage threshold which represents the damage amount that must be met before the vehicle loses hit points. If the vehicle is hit by a single instance of damage that fails to meet its damage threshold, it instead takes no damage. A vehicle’s damage threshold appears in parentheses next to the vehicle’s AC.
## Hit Points
This works like creature hit points, though a vehicle is destroyed when it drops to 0 HP. A vehicle reduced to 0 HP is beyond repair (see Vehicle Repairs in this section).
## Speed
A vehicle’s movement is measured in feet and miles per hour. The speed in feet is for use in combat or any encounter that requires initiative. The miles per hour and per day measurements are used when traveling long distances (see Travel Pace).
## Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities
Like creatures, vehicles can be vulnerable, resistant, and immune to certain damage types or conditions. Like most items, vehicles are immune to poison and psychic damage, and the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, stunned, and unconscious. Instead of writing all those immunities out in each stat block, a vehicle that fits this standard has Vehicle Resilience in the Immune line of its stat block.
## Initiative
Each vehicle has a set count for when it acts in initiative and loses ties with non-vehicles. In case of ties between vehicles, the GM determines their initiative order. For more on initiative rules, see the Initiative section.
## Crew
A vehicle needs a crew to operate. It can’t move or take actions on its turn unless it has the number of required crew members. A crew member doesn’t roll their own initiative in combat since their actions and movement are fully dedicated to operating the vehicle.

A crew member must be capable of performing their tasks. A Beast, for example, is unlikely to have the skills necessary to operate a vehicle with complex mechanical controls. While there are no specifically designated roles for each vehicle or vessel, the GM has final say on whether a creature qualifies as a crew member.
## Passengers
Some vehicles can carry passengers in addition to crew. This section assumes the passengers are Small or Medium creatures.
## Cargo Capacity
Cargo capacity refers to the carrying capacity of non-essential goods and materials. This capacity is measured in pounds or tons; however, a GM can rule that the nature of a vehicle prevents it from carrying certain kinds of cargo.
## Actions
On each of its turns, a vehicle with the required number of crew members a vehicle can move up to its speed and use one action—just like a PC or monster.
# Vehicle Movement
While in initiative, at the start of a vehicle’s turn, crew members can pick the direction they want the vehicle to go. Due to size and bulk, most vehicles can only use their movement to travel in a single direction during their turn. A vehicle with a full crew can move up to its speed on its turn. A vehicle with fewer than half its crew members can only move up to half its speed on its turn. A vehicle with no crew members has a speed of 0 feet.

Some vehicles have the Maneuverable trait which allows them to turn and travel in different directions on the same turn. If a vehicle has the Maneuverable trait, it is noted in parentheses after its speed.

Outside of initiative, crew members can change a vehicle’s direction as they wish.
# Vehicle Repairs
When a vehicle is damaged, a creature with proficiency in that type of vehicle and the appropriate tools and materials can attempt to repair the vehicle in one of two ways: a patch job or replacing parts. Unless specified otherwise, a creature can’t conduct repairs on a vehicle while it is moving or in use.
## Patch Job
If the vehicle is damaged but has at least half its hit points (rounded down), a creature can spend 1 hour patching the damage. At the end of the hour, the vehicle regains a number of temporary hit points equal to its AC (up to the vehicle’s hit point maximum). These temporary hit points last until depleted. A vehicle can only gain temporary hit points in this way once per day.
## Replace Parts
If a vehicle has taken damage and has fewer than half its hit points (rounded down), a creature can spend 1 hour or more and the necessary gp worth of spare parts to repair the damage. At the end of each hour, the vehicle regains hit points equal to its AC (up to the vehicle’s hit point maximum). One hour of repairs requires spare parts worth a gp amount equal to 10 percent of the vehicle’s base cost, as shown on the **Vehicle Base Cost** table.
