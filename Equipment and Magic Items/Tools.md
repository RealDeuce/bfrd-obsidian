## Tools
Sometimes a tool is a single item, like a musical instrument. Other times a tool encompasses a kit or set of supplies containing multiple items. When using a tool, you must have all of its component items to make ability checks with it.

Just like skills, you don’t need to be proficient in a tool to use it, but proficiency with a tool allows you to add your PB to ability checks you make using that tool.

Also, like skills, tools aren’t tied to specific ability scores. The ability score assigned to each ability check using a tool depends on what you are trying to accomplish. For example, when using construction tools, the GM might ask you to make a STR (Construction Tools) check to hammer nails into a hard surface, but ask for a DEX (Construction Tools) check to use the same tools to carve a wooden sculpture.

Alchemist tools are used to perform a variety of tasks such as identifying potions or foreign substances, mixing reagents together to cause alchemical reactions, and crafting alchemical substances.

***Associated Abilities:*** DEX, INT.

***Craft Items.*** Alchemist tools can be used to make items like those listed in the Alchemical Concoctions section of the **Adventuring Gear** table, with the crafting downtime activity.
#### Artist Tools

#### Charlatan Tools
Charlatan tools are used to craft disguises and forge documents.

***Associated Abilities:*** DEX, CHA.

***Components.*** This tool kit includes hair dyes, small props, cosmetics, a few choice articles of clothing, a selection of wax seals, gold and silver leaf, inks, a variety of parchments, and sculpting tools to fashion melted wax into seals or prosthetics.

***Create Disguise.*** Over the course of an hour (which can be done as part of a rest) you can create a disguise to make yourself or someone else—including any clothing or equipment—look like a different creature. A disguise can make a creature seem slightly taller, shorter, fatter, or thinner, but can’t conceal true size or basic arrangement of limbs. It takes 1 minute to don such a disguise once created. A set of charlatan tools only has enough materials to create one disguise at a time, but you can disassemble a disguise to create a new disguise as part of the time spent making a disguise. A creature can use its action to inspect a disguised appearance, and must succeed on an INT (Investigation) contest versus your DEX (Charlatan Tools) to discern a disguise.

***Forge Documents.*** Over the course of one hour (which can be done as part of a rest) you can create a simple false document of 5 pages or less—like a personal letter, a party invitation, or a sales permit. With the GM’s permission you can create longer or more complicated documents over the course of several hours or days. A creature can use its action to inspect a forged document, and must succeed on an INT (Investigation) contest versus your DEX (Charlatan Tools) check to discern a forgery.

***Fortify.*** You can spend 1 minute fortifying a chest, door, window, or other sealable object or structure. When you do so, the object’s AC increases by an amount equal to your PB or creatures have disadvantage on STR (Athletics) checks made to penetrate the fortification (the GM decides which is more relevant). An item doesn’t receive additional benefits from multiple attempts to fortify it.

***Build Cover.*** You can spend 1 hour (which can be done as part of a long rest) erecting a 5-foot by 5-foot wall panel in an unoccupied space, provided you have the raw materials to do so. The panel provides three-quarters cover for one Medium or smaller creature, and it can’t be moved. A panel of cover created with this feature is an object with an AC equal to 10 + your PB and 15 HP if made of wood or 25 HP if made of stone. It is immune to psychic and poison damage.
