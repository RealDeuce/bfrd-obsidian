Siege weapons are a unique type of object that functions similarly to a standard weapon.
# Elements of a Siege Weapon
Each siege weapon has the following characteristics.
## Size and Type
Every siege weapon has a listed size just like creatures do. Every siege weapon is an object.
## Armor Class and Damage Threshold
Each siege weapon has an AC that determines how difficult it is to hit. In addition, siege weapons have a damage threshold that represents the damage amount that must be met before the siege weapon loses hit points. If the siege weapon is hit by a single instance of damage that fails to meet its damage threshold, it instead takes no damage. A siege weapon’s damage threshold appears in parenthesis next to its AC.
## Hit Points
This works like creature hit points, though a siege weapon is destroyed when it drops to 0 HP. A damaged siege weapon can be repaired in the same way a vehicle can. A siege weapon reduced to 0 HP is beyond repair.
## Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities
Like creatures, siege weapons can be vulnerable, resistant, and immune to certain damage types or conditions. Like most items, siege weapons are immune to poison and psychic damage and to the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, stunned, and unconscious. Instead of writing all those immunities in each stat block, a siege weapon that fits this standard has Siege Weapon Resilience in the Immune line of its stat block.
## Special Features
Siege weapons don’t have actions, but they can be used to create unique effects or to make special attacks. Most siege weapons require at least two actions to use such special features, and armies employing siege weapons tend to have full crews operating them to ensure the siege weapon never ceases firing. The siege weapon’s statistics detail if the siege weapon can’t be used more than once each round.

*Siege Weapon Damage.* If a siege weapon deals damage, that damage is doubled against objects and structures.
# Siege Weapon Movement
Siege weapons are standalone objects that are most often affixed to a structure, such as a hanging cauldron on a castle wall. While some siege weapons can have wheels, siege weapons don’t have a speed and must be carried or moved by creatures or vehicles.
## Attaching Siege Weapons to Vehicles
Siege weapons can be mounted on vehicles large enough to support them. To affix a siege weapon to a vehicle, the vehicle must be at least one size category larger than the siege weapon. The siege weapon costs the same whether it is by itself or affixed to a vehicle. A creature using a siege weapon affixed to a vehicle can use the vehicle’s STR modifier instead of the siege weapon’s standard attack bonus if the vehicle’s bonus is higher, and the attacker can add the vehicle’s STR modifier to the damage dealt by the siege weapon.
# Siege Weapon Descriptions
This section contains several common siege weapons.
###### Siege Weapon Base Cost
| Item | Cost |
| ---- | ---- |
| Ballista | 500 gp |
| Battering Ram | 60 gp (75 gp on wheeled frame) |
| Hanging Cauldron | 50 gp |
| Mangonel | 750 gp |
| Trebuchet | 1,200 gp |
## Ballista
*Large Object*  
**Armor Class** 15 (damage threshold 5)  
**Hit Points** 50  
**Immune** Siege Weapon Resilience

Ballistae resemble oversized crossbows, capable of firing massive bolts. These siege weapons are common fixtures on the decks of sailing vessels and other combat-ready vehicles. To fire a ballista, one action must be used to load it, and a second action must be spent to use its Bolt attack.

***Bolt.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d10) piercing damage.
## Battering Ram
*Large Object*
**Armor Class** 17 (damage threshold 10)
**Hit Points** 100
**Immune** Siege Weapon Resilience

Battering rams are oblong constructions of metal and wood used to break through doors, walls, and similar barriers. A battering ram can be fixed in place by suspending it from chains affixed to a ceiling or it can be made portable by affixing it to a wheeled wooden framework. Regardless of how it is supported, at least six Medium creatures or two Large or larger creatures must be within 5 feet of the battering ram and spend at least half their movement speed on their turn to operate the ram. Once the required number of creatures have spent their movement, one of the operators must spend an action to use the Ram attack. A battering ram can perform the Ram action only once per round.

***Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage.
## Hanging Cauldron
*Medium Object*  
**Armor Class** 19 (damage threshold 5)  
**Hit Points** 50  
**Immune** Siege Weapon Resilience

Hanging cauldrons are deep iron pots suspended from a fixed metal frame. While the weight of the cauldron is supported by the frame, it is constructed to allow an operator to easily tip the vessel, pouring its contents onto targets that pass below. Before a cauldron can be used, it must be filled with at least 8 gallons of liquid (one fifth of a standard barrel). Pouring 8 gallons of liquid into the cauldron takes one action. The cauldron can hold up to 24 gallons of liquid at once. Once filled, a creature within 5 feet of the cauldron can use an action to cause one of the following effects (determined by the liquid type). Each use of the cauldron expends 8 gallons of liquid, regardless of type.
* ***Boiling Water.*** Scalding-hot water spills out of the cauldron in a 10-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point on the ground directly beneath the cauldron. The cylinder’s height is equal to the distance, in feet, between that point and the bottom of the cauldron. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 DEX save, taking 11 (2d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
* ***Grease.*** Slippery cooking grease spills out of the cauldron, splattering in a 5-foot radius area centered on a point on the ground directly beneath the cauldron. The area is difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature in the area when the grease is poured must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or fall prone. For the duration, a creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or fall prone.
* ***Flaming Oil.*** Flaming oil spills out of the cauldron in a 5-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point on the ground directly beneath the cauldron. The cylinder’s height is equal to the distance, in feet, between that point and the bottom of the cauldron. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 DEX save. On a failure, a creature takes 11 (2d10) fire damage and catches on fire. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn’t catch on fire. Flammable objects in the area also catch on fire. A creature or object on fire takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature, including the creature on fire, can take its action to extinguish the fire, ending the effect.
## Mangonel
*Large Object*  
**Armor Class** 15 (damage threshold 7)  
**Hit Points** 100  
**Immune** Siege Weapon Resilience

Mangonels are catapults capable of hurling heavy stones (or similar projectiles) incredible distances. Given the high arc of this fire, mangonels are ideal for firing over walls or other forms of cover. To fire a mangonel, one action must be used to load it, and a second action must be spent to use its Launch attack. The mangonel can’t target creatures, objects, vehicles, or structures within 60 feet of it.

***Launch.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 hit, range 200/800 ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage.
## Trebuchet
*Huge Object*  
**Armor Class** 10 (damage threshold 15)  
**Hit Points** 150  
**Immune** Siege Weapon Resilience

Trebuchets are massive and powerful catapults capable of hurling boulders, barrels, and similar projectiles incredible distances. To fire a trebuchet, two actions must be used to load it, one action is required to aim it, and finally, one action must be spent to use its Hurl attack. The trebuchet can’t target creatures, objects, vehicles, or structures within 60 feet of it.

***Hurl.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 hit, range 300/1,200 ft., one target. *Hit:* 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage. Each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or take bludgeoning damage equal to half the damage dealt by the attack.
