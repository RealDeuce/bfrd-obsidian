***Acid.*** As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.

***Alchemist’s Fire.*** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist’s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 DEX (Sleight of Hand) check to extinguish the flames.

***Antitoxin.*** A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saves against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to Undead or Constructs.

***Arcane Focus.*** This item can be used as a spellcasting focus to channel Arcane spells. Examples include an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially made staff, or a wooden wand.

***Ball Bearings.*** As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area, 10 feet on a side. A creature moving in this area must succeed on a DC 10 DEX save or fall prone. A creature moving in the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.

***Block and Tackle.*** This is a set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to items. A block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.

***Book.*** A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a field of lore, diagrams, notes on contraptions, or just about anything that can be represented using text or pictures. A spellbook is a separate item described later in this section.

***Caltrops.*** As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. A Large or smaller creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.

***Candle.*** For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

***Case, Map or Scroll.*** This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper.

***Chain.*** A chain is an object that has AC 20 and 10 HP. It can be broken as an action with a successful DC 20 STR (Athletics) check.

***Climber’s Kit.*** A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself to a solid surface within 5 feet of you (this surface can’t be part of a creature); when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from your anchor point, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.

***Component Pouch.*** A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those material components that have a listed gp cost (as indicated in a spell’s description).

***Crowbar.*** Using a crowbar grants advantage to STR checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.

***Fishing Tackle.*** This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, iron hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and netting.

***Healer’s Kit.*** This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has 10 uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 HP without needing to make a WIS (Medicine) check.

***Holy Symbol.*** This item can be used as a spellcasting focus to channel Divine spells. Examples include an amulet depicting a deity’s symbol, that same symbol engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic.

***Holy Water.*** As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a Fiend or Undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage—otherwise, the water has no effect.

A creature that can cast at least one 1st-circle Divine spells can create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st- circle spell slot.

***Hunting Trap, Basic.*** As an action, you can set a trap in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. When set, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. A Large or smaller creature that enters the trap’s space must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or take 1d4 piercing damage and become grappled until freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 STR (Athletics) check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.

***Lamp.*** While lit, a lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

***Lantern, Bullseye.*** While lit, a bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

***Lantern, Hooded.*** While lit, a hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

***Lock.*** A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 DEX (Thieves’ Tools) check. Your GM can decide that better locks are available for higher prices.

***Magnifying Glass.*** This lens allows a closer look at small items. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires sunlight to focus, tinder to light, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.

***Manacles.*** These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. To escape the manacles, a creature must use their action to make a successful DC 20 DEX (Sleight of Hand) check or break them with a successful DC 20 STR (Athletics) check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 DEX (Thieves’ Tools) check. Manacles are an object that has AC 19 and 15 HP.

***Mess Kit.*** This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together; one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

***Net.*** As an action, you can throw a net at a Large or smaller creature within 15 feet of you. The net has no effect on creatures that are formless or incorporeal (like ghosts). Make a ranged attack against the creature, treating the net as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 STR (Athletics) check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

***Oil.*** Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash oil onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the flask up to 20 feet, shattering on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

***Poison, Basic (Injury).*** You can use the poison in this vial to coat one weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition that deal piercing or slashing damage. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or take 1d4 poison damage (in addition to the weapon’s normal damage). Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

***Poison, Essence of Ether (Inhaled).*** A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or be poisoned for 8 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The unconscious effect ends if the creature takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

***Poison, Last Gasp (Contact).*** A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending both effects on a success.

***Poison, Midnight Tears (Ingested).*** A creature who ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 CON save, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.

***Potion of Healing.*** A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action. For more information about this item, see [[./Magic Items/Potion of Healing|potion of healing]] in the **Magic Item Descriptions**.

***Pouch.*** A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).

***Primordial Focus.*** This item can be used as a spellcasting focus to channel Primordial spells. Examples include a totem made from natural materials like feather or bone, a wooden staff carved from a living tree, or a yew wand.

***Quiver.*** A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows or 20 crossbow bolts.

***Ram, Portable.*** You can use a portable ram to break down doors. You have advantage on relevant STR (Athletic) checks made to do so.

***Rations.*** Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts. One unit of rations is enough to feed one Medium or smaller creature for one day.

***Rope.*** Rope is an object with AC 11 and 2 HP. It can be burst with a DC 17 STR (Athletics) check.

***Scale, Merchant’s.*** A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 lb. With it, you can measure the exact weight of suitably sized objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.

***Spellbook.*** A spellbook is a leather‑bound tome with 100 blank pages suitable for recording spells.

***Spyglass.*** Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. A spyglass grants advantage on any ability check made to view or inspect items that are far away.

***Tent.*** A simple, portable canvas shelter that sleeps two Medium or smaller creatures.

***Tinderbox.*** This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.

***Torch.*** A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

***Wyrd Focus.*** This item can be used as a spellcasting focus to channel Wyrd spells. Examples include an amulet carved from bone, a charm bag filled with rare herbs and crystals, or a wand made of starmetal.
