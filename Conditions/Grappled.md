* A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* The condition ends if the grappler is [[Incapacitated|incapacitated]] (can’t take actions or reactions).
* The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the *[[../Spellcasting/Spells/Thunderwave|thunderwave]]* spell.
