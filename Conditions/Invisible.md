* An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. A creature with the invisible condition can always attempt to hide and has advantage on DEX (Stealth) checks to do so. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
* Attack rolls against an invisible creature have disadvantage, and an invisible creature’s attack rolls have advantage.
